            <p>A complete guide to understand what is copywriting, why good copywriting matters including the main steps to maximise the impact of your content<br>
              <br>

              Advertising your products and services doesn't always get you the results you need. Most of the time, it's because the words on your website, in your marketing emails, or on your social media platforms are poorly written or ineffective at getting people to take the final step of making a purchase.  </p>

            <h3 class="mb-3 mt-5">1. Understand What Is Copywriting</h3>
            <p>The term copywriting refers to any piece of writing that is meant to sell, convert, and generate leads. That's it! <br>
              <br>

              Sometimes, the terms copywriting and content writing are used interchangeably, but they have different purposes. The purpose of content writing is to inform, while the purpose of copywriting is to sell. In content marketing, both techniques are used to create content that both informs and sells.</p>
             
             <h5>Where do you need copy?</h5> 
             <p>All the content geared at selling and converting for your business is called copy. You'll find copy everywhere. For example, on your website, it's in landing pages, calls to action on blog post footers, pop-ups, and more. Copy is in your emails, press releases, social media shares, print, and digital advertising.</p>

             <h3>2. Understand Why Does Good Copy Matter For Your Business</h3>
             <p>Surely, you want your business to do well. For that to happen, you need to sell your products or be hired for your services. That's where good copy comes in. The main point of copy is for people to see your ads, social media shares, landing pages and more and feel inspired to spend their money. That's why good copywriting is essential for turning leads into paying clients. <br>
              <br>

              There's a progression of positive things that good copy does for your business;</p>
              <p>1. First, it makes an emotional impact on potential clients with words. <br>

                2. This emotional impact makes them feel like they can relate to your brand. <br>
                
                3. When they relate, they will feel like your brand can solve their problem or pain point. <br>
                
                4. The call-to-action helps motivate them to make a purchase. <br>
                
                5. This leads to increased sales and conversions for your business.</p>
               
              <h5>Good copy vs bad copy</h5>
              <p>Are you wondering what exactly constitutes "good copy?" Well, as you can imagine, there is also plenty of bad copy. Mostly written by people that didn't do the foundation work necessary to pinpoint the brand's Unique Value Proposition (UVP). <br>
                <br>

                Let's do a little comparison between good and bad copy. Take, for example, an ad for a hair salon that offers cutting solutions during the quarantine.</p>  
               
              <h6>The bad copy</h6>
              <p>"Cut your hair at home with this guide."</p>
              <h6>The good copy</h6>
              <p>"Thinking of cutting your bangs yourself? We can help!  With this easy step-by-step video guide, you'll have great looking bangs in no time. 5 different bangs styles included.  Need further assistance? Let's do a video call and we'll guide you." <br>
                <br>

                Your company and your business need good copy to get to the next level. The smartest way to add good copy to your content is to hire a copywriter that will dig deep into your business and its goals.</p>  
               
              <h3>3. Understand What Are The Benefits Of Hiring A Copywriter</h3>
              <p>Being a business owner doesn't mean you're an expert copywriter. It takes specific skills and the right frame of mind to create copy that will accomplish the right goals in the right place at the right time. Publishing copy without a strategy can have a negative effect on your business and will take time and money to fix. <br>
                <br>

                Hiring a copywriter can help you: </p>
                <p><li>Write powerful, effective copy for your specific business needs</li></p> 

                <p><li>  Ensure your copy is free of grammar and spelling errors</li></p> 
                  
                <p><li> See your business through a new perspective</li></p> 
                  
                <p><li> Release the tension of having to write the copy yourself</li></p> 
                  
                <p><li>Save you and your employees time destined for other tasks</li></p>  
               
              <h3>4. Prepare Your Content The Right Way</h3>
              <p>The first step is to define the overall purpose and goal for the copywriting work you seek. The following list is the foundation that will help inform your content brief. </p>
              <h6><li>Define the content type. </li></h6>  <p> First, you have to define what type of copy needs to be written. Is it a landing page, sales page, or an entire social media campaign? Or maybe it's the copy for your website redesign. Start noting this down in a document where you will be consolidating all the information.</p>
              <h6><li>Define your business goals. </li></h6> <p>What is your business's mission statement? Why do you sell or offer what you do? Write down the purpose of your business in an easy-to-understand paragraph. This is the driving force for all the work the copywriter will do for you.</p>
              <h6><li>Define your uniqueness.</li></h6> <p> Looking at what needs to be written, list out any products or services which are mentioned or included. Define each one with its most important features and specifications. What can customers benefit from these products or services? What is the unique value proposition?What puts you over the competition? </p>
              <h6><li>Define your target customer.</li></h6> <p>Who is your ideal audience? Define in detail your user persona. Your copywriter needs to know who they're writing for and who it will be directed at. Be detailed in your descriptions. Start at the quantitative descriptions like age, gender, location, occupation and continue with qualitative features like what they like or dislike, what their hobbies and personal interests are. </p>
              <h6><li>Define customer pain points.</li></h6> <p> Note down your ideal customer's pain points. A pain point is something in their life or work that isn't working quite right and needs fixing. How do your products and services fill that gap and solve the problem? Be specific.</p>

              <h3>5. Perform A Keyword Research</h3>
              <p>Let's go through the steps of doing a keyword research to set up a foundation for the copy you need. You might have already done this for your business as a whole. But every new landing page, product sheet, or sales copy needs its own set of keywords.</p>
              <h5>Let's start with your keyword research</h5>
              <h6>Define your keywords</h6>
              <p>The first step is to define the main keywords for the copy. These are the queries your audience will type into Google or other search engines to attempt to find a solution to their problem—and you want your business to be the solution! <br>
                <br>

                From there,  branch out to long-tail keywords, question keywords, and LSI related term keywords. For this research, use tools like SEMRush, Answer the Public, Buzzsumo, Ahrefs, Ubbersuggest, or Moz. Organize the keywords in a spreadsheet so that your copywriter can see their competitive score. Most of the tools mentioned above offer CSV downloads.</p>
               
              <h6>Conduct Google searches</h6> 
              <p>With your keywords in hand, conduct Google searches to see what shows up. Take notes on your competitors' copy and how they've put it together. Pay attention to whether Google is returning informational, navigational, or transactional content to be sure that the content you create lines up with the intent of the keywords. If there are any results that catch your eye as something you'd like to have for your own business, keep a reference of it to show your copywriter. </p>
              
              <h6>Analyze Google trends</h6>
              <p>Use the Google Trends tool to do a bit more research about your keywords. Google Trends will show you the popularity of your search terms and whether the number of people searching for them in a given time period is increasing, decreasing, or staying the same. If a keyword is trending downward, it might not be a sustainable way to get traffic to your website. </p>

              <h3>6. Organize Your Content Efficiently </h3>
              <p>When you hire a copywriter, you'll give them a brief to work with. A good copywriter will usually have more questions to clarify or double-check things on your brief. Nevertheless, you need to be as thorough as possible to ensure the best optimal outcome. <br>

                The section above about preparing the content is the first part of the brief for your copywriter. After that comes the actual information that they will need to work with. For things to flow smoothly, you need to organize it all. <br>
                
                Let's take a look at how to organize the content your copywriter will need to draft your copy.</p>
               
              <h5><li>Define the topic and put together a topic map</li></h5>  
              <p>At this point, you already know what type of content you need. Now it's time to define the topic. Use the information from your keyword research, Google searches, and competitor analysis to find a topic that both solves your clients’ pain points and is something that falls in line with your business and industry. An ideal content topic will be something people are frequently looking for but can't find exactly what they need—so your business will provide it, drawing in more traffic for you. <br>
                <br>

                After you've defined the main topic of the content you need to be written, create a list of the sub-topics your copy will also need to include. These will form the subheadings of your copy. Sub-topics should be closely related to your main topic, but cover different facets to provide thorough information to your readers. <br>
                <br>
                
                You may have some sub-topics in mind immediately, but if you need help finding them, there a couple of strategies you can use:</p>
               
               <p><li>Google your main keyword and look at the "related searches" at the bottom of the page. Many of these will be closely related sub-topics.  </li></p> 

               <p><li> Find the Wikipedia page for your topic and pull from the table of contents.  </li></p> 
                
               <p><li> Look at competitor content and ensure that you are covering similar points, while also adding extra value that puts you above your competitors. </li></p> 
              
             <h5><li>List your references, sources, and inspiration</li></h5>
             <p>While defining keywords, doing Google searches, analyzing trends, and doing a competitor analysis, you surely came across content that you were inspired by. Keep those in a list with links or take screenshots. If the copy needs technical information, put that all together in a folder as reference for the copywriter.</p>
             <h5><li>Set a temporary title</li></h5>
             <p>Come up with a temporary title for the project and for the intended body of copy. This will help keep all things in mental order for you, your team, and the copywriter. Your copywriter can rewrite the title to be maximally effective when published. </p> 
             <h5><li>Set up a content style guideline for your copywriter to follow</li></h5>
             <p>By now you should have a folder with documents, spreadsheets, and references. The next thing to complete the content brief is the content style guideline. This guideline can be reused for other projects. You only have to create it once and then tweak according to each project. <br>
              <br>

              Here's a quick list of what goes into a content style guide:</p> 
             
             <p>1. Brand mission and values: Start off the content brief with an introduction to your business and what it stands for. What is the brand mission, brand story, and company values? What does your business solve for people and how?

              2. Copy preferences and rules: Continue by laying the ground rules for the copywriter. For example, there might be words and terms that your brand can't use. Or maybe you want to stay away from copy that is too pushy or repetitive. <br>
              
              3. Editorials rules and recommendations: Make sure to express in the content brief that you expect perfect grammar, spelling, and syntax in the copy. Offer suggestions for use of contractions or to stay away from overly technical words.<br>
              
              4. Purpose and Objective: Next up is the part where you explain the purpose of the project and what goals you'd like to achieve. Do you want to sell more products? Are you looking to bring in more members to your site? Also, include expected results from the project.<br>
              
              5. Target Audience: Describe the target audience in detail; who they are, where do they work, what they need, what they expect from your brand. Be specific as to what kind of language resonates with this audience so the copywriter knows who to write for and how.<br>
              
              6. Voice: The voice is what defines your brand when readers come across your copy. It has to match any other copy that you already have published so that customers aren't confused.<br>
              
              7. Tone: Give detailed instructions about the tone; is it authoritative, friendly, or educational? Is it conversational or leaning towards an academic tone? The tone and voice go hand in hand with each other and you have to describe that to the copywriter.<br>
              
              8. Style: Define things like; using short sentences, not using exclamation marks, or using them at will. Explain to the copywriter if they should use bold or italic words and terms in the copy. Include if you'd like them to use quotes from experts and explain which ones are suitable.</p> 
             
             <h5><li>Choose a preferred structure for your content</li></h5>
             <p>Continuing with how the copy looks, explain in detail how you prefer the copy to be structured. For example, copy for a landing page must follow a specific structure with H1 headings above the fold, H2, and H3 headings interspersed in the following sections and text blocks with no more than a certain number of characters. Other types of content, like brochures, need a detailed explanation due to how the print will be folded. Include visual examples from previously published content. Remember that the copywriter's job is to improve the copy, not the design.</p>
             <h5><li>Organize all the visual assets</li></h5> 
             <p>Don't forget to add the visuals that will go with the copy. Even though the copywriter won't be creating or editing any visuals, they need to know what visuals will be included in the final design. You can also ask the copywriter to write captions and alt text for the visuals. <br>
              <br>

              If the visuals haven't been defined by the time you hire the copywriter, include inspiration visuals that will give a clear idea of what will be included later. <br>
              <br>
              
              Add the visuals in a folder or set them up on one sheet for easy viewing. If the new copy is meant for an already designed landing page, screenshot the design or include the link in the content brief.</p>
             
            <h3>7. Create Your Copy Guidelines</h3>
            <p>Now it's time to put it all together in the brief. It can be a folder in Google drive, or it can be discussed on a call after an email. Either way, all the information you put together goes inside the content brief. Organize it into sections so it's easier to understand. The more information you give a copywriter about your project objective and goals, the better your results will be.</p> 
            <h5>Define the assignment guidelines for productivity and communication</h5>
            <p>But wait, there's one more thing you need to add to the content brief. It's a closing section about how you expect the project to be tackled as a team between you and the copywriter. <br>
              <br>

              Include these things in the assignment guidelines:</p> 
              <h6><li>Your preferred communication platform.</li></h6> <p>Let your potential copywriter know about how you'd like to communicate. Do you prefer email and Google docs or do you rather bring the copywriter into your Slack platform? Other options are Basecamp or ClickUp.</p>
              <h6><li>Deadlines for drafts and revisions.</li></h6> <p>Set up a schedule for drafts and revisions. When you hire the copywriter, this might have some adjustments to fit both your schedules. You'll have to later set up deadlines inside your communication platform with reminders and checklists.</p>
              <h6><li>Deadline for the finalized project. </li></h6> <p>Choose a preliminary deadline for the project. Don't forget to leave some leeway for any setbacks or complications. It's better to set the final deadline for a day or two before you'd really like to have the project finished.</p>
              <h6><li>Detailed timezones for members involved in the project.</li></h6> <p> If your team is remote and in different parts of the world, they all work at different times of the day. If your copywriter will need to talk to someone on your team, it's best to inform everyone about the different timezones. That way, no one will be expecting responses at inappropriate times.</p>

              <h3>8. Find And Hire The Right Copywriter For Your Project</h3>
              <p>Congrats. You're ready to hire a copywriter. <br>
                <br>

                But here's the thing: you need the right copywriter for your project. Let's take a look at what you need to do.</p>
                <h5><li>Define the type of copywriter you need</li></h5>
                <p>With all the preparation you've done, you should have a good idea of what type of copywriter to look for. Do you need an email copywriter, or a product sales copywriter, maybe a podcast placement copywriter? Many copywriters can work in any style, but some specialize in particular fields. If you have a specific need or goal, it's best to look for a specialized writer. <br>
                  <br>

                  Copywriters may also have different levels of experience, which likely affects their skills and rate. Hiring a junior copywriter might be the best fit for your budget, and this can be a great first step for your business. Just remember, at a minimum, copywriters should be able to: </p>

                  <p><li>Create engaging and persuasive copy</li></p>

                  <p><li>  Write with minimal grammar and spelling errors</li></p>
                    
                  <p><li>  Meet deadlines</li></p>
                    
                  <p><li>  Work under pressure</li></p>
                    
                  <p><li>  Take constructive criticism</li></p>
                    
                  <p><li>  Have fresh eyes on your company without a predisposed bias</li></p>
                    
                  <p><li>  Take their time to strategize your content so that it converts</li></p>
                 <h3>10. Continue Driving Traffic After Publication</h3>
                 <p>Congratulations on publishing the content you worked so hard on, now what? <br>
                  <br>

                  On the day of publication, there are a number of things you should do to maximize the impact of your content. <br>
                  <br>
                  
                  Here are some practical ideas to get more eyeball on your content:</p>
                 
                 <h6><li>Nurture your leads.</li></h6> <p>If you did any pre-promotion and gathered email leads, the first thing you need to do is send out an email beamer to that list. It there wasn't any pre-promotion, send a newsletter to your actual mailing list to present your new content. Don't forget to add the link and some exciting terms to get them to click. Remember that your copywriter can help write these emails.</p>
                 <h6><li>Create social media hype. </li></h6> <p>Share on all your social media channels to spread the excitement. If there was pre-promotion, use terms like "It's here!" or "Here's what you've been waiting for," etc.</p>
                 <h6><li>Go Live. </li></h6> <p>Create a live video telling your followers about your new content and let them know where they can see it.</p>

                 <h5>How to promote after publication?</h5>

                 <p>After the first efforts upon publication, there are other things you can do to promote your content further. There's a myriad of ways that your content can spread far and wide. All you need is some outreach efforts and a social media strategy. <br>
                  <br>

                  Promote your new copy with the following strategies:</p>
                  <p><li>Link the newly published copy to already published content on your site.</li></p>

                  <p><li> Send outreach emails to prospects that might want to include your link in their own content, including the people you quoted in the copy so they can share with their own followers.</li></p>
                    
                  <p><li> Create Facebook ads or other types of ads on services like Google ads.</li></p>
                    
                  <p><li> Set up a social media strategy that spans over time. </li></p>

                 <h3>11. Repurpose Your Content To Increase Exposure</h3>
                 <p>As you saw above, there are many ways to promote your new copy before, on the day of publication and few days after. But if you want to increase the exposure of your reach you must think about different ways to repurpose your content under different forms and via different channels. <br>
                  <br>

                  Bottom line, you need to set up an evergreen strategy so that your content continues to drive new traffic over the time. <br>
                  <br>
                  
                  Here are 8 ways that your content can be repurposed</p>
                 
                 <p><li>Create an infographic</li></p>

                 <p><li> Convert it into an ebook</li></p>
                  
                 <p><li> Put together an interactive presentation</li></p>
                  
                 <p><li> Turn it into a video</li></p>
                  
                 <p><li>  Create a podcast</li></p>
                  
                 <p><li> Answer a number of related questions on Quora </li></p>
                  
                 <p><li> Turn it into a webinar</li></p>
                  
                 <p><li> Update it with new information and republish</li></p> 

                
              <p>If the copy for this project is for a piece of evergreen content, then it's much easier to repurpose and refresh. <br>
                <br>

                Evergreen content has the potential to drive traffic and to be shared consistently for a long time, even years. Just make sure to revisit it and update any outdated information.</p>

              <p>Copywriting doesn't have to be mysterious or complicated. It takes planning, skill, and a deep understanding of your business needs and goals, but the benefits of a good copywriting strategy can not be overstated. <br>
                <br>
