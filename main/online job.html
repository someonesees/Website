            <h3 class="mb-3 mt-5">1. Find a business idea</h3>
           <p>All great home-based, online businesses start with an idea. This can be one of the most daunting parts of starting an online business: where do you even begin? <br>
            <br>

            The following strategies will have you overflowing with business ideas in no time.</p>
            <p>The best place to start is by looking at your own skills, expertise, and knowledge. Generate ideas by asking yourself:</p>
            <p><li>What areas have I studied, whether at university, college, through an online course, at a workshop, etc.?</li></p>
            <p><li>What subjects have I taught to others before? For example, are you the go-to person in your current workplace when it comes to training new employees about certain systems, software, or skills?</li></p>
            <p><li>What topics have you researched the most, whether for work, education, or your own curiosity?</li></p>
            <p><li>What class did you perform the best in during school or college?</li></p>
            <h5>What do your friends and family say you’re good at?</h5>
            <p>Sometimes, we fail to see our own talents, so this is where our friends and family can help us out.</p>
            <p><li>What do your loved ones compliment you about the most?</li></p>
            <p><li>Growing up, were you often told you were particularly good at something?</li></p>
            <p>Reach out to your friends and family and ask them where they think your talents and skill set lie. </p>
            <h5>Ask your former employees what they best remember you for</h5>
            <p>If you’re still in contact with any former coworkers or employees, get in touch with them to find out what they best remember about you. <br>
              <br>

              Was it your patience when they needed your help? Or perhaps your excellent, easy-to-understand way of explaining more complex subjects? The answers to these questions may help you identify where you shine in a business context. </p>
             
             <h5>“Always think outside the box and embrace opportunities that appear, wherever they might be”</h5> 
            
            <h3>2. Find what to sell online</h3>
            <p>Once you’ve brainstormed ideas for what type of business you can start, the next step is to work out what your business should sell online, which will be either products, services, or your know-how.</p> 
            <h5>Products </h5>
            <p>These are physical objects made available for consumer use. Unlike services or know-how, products are tangible. That is, they can be picked up, touched, and interacted with. <br>
              <br>

              Examples of products being sold online include:</p>
             
             <p><li>Painting</li></p>

              <p><li>Gadgets</li></p>
              <p><li>Crafts</li></p>
              <h5>Services </h5>
              <p>Services can be defined as tasks performed in a professional and knowledgeable manner by an individual or team for the benefit of its customers. <br>
                <br>

                Examples of services that can be sold online are:</p>
                <p><li>Teaching a language online</li></p>
                <p><li>Virtual assistance</li></p>
                <p><li>Online architectural services</li></p>
                <p><li>Fitness and nutrition consultation</li></p>
                <p><li>Online relationship coaching</li></p>
              <h5>Know-How </h5>
              <p>If you’re knowledgeable about a particular topic that is of interest to your target audience, you can sell your knowledge in one of these forms: 

              </p>
              <p><li>Video</li></p>
              <p><li>White paper</li></p>
              <p><li>eBook</li></p>
              <p><li>Podcast</li></p>
              <p><li>Webinar</li></p>
              <p><li>Online course or workshop</li></p>

              <h5>“What do you need to start a business? Three simple things: know your product better than anyone, know your customer, and have a burning desire to succeed”</h5>
              <p>When selling your know-how online, you’ll want to focus on four important factors to ensure its success:</p>
              <p><li>Provide your target audience with an answer to their biggest problems. What are they trying to achieve or overcome? Based on your knowledge, what are the necessary steps to do so?</li></p>

              <p><li> Offer your know-how at various price points to make it accessible for a wide range of your target audience. For example, you might have an eBook priced at ₹400, a 7-day email course priced at ₹750, and an in-depth video course with printable workbooks priced at ₹2500.</li></p>
                
                <p><li> Set up necessary online channels to market what you’re selling, including a website, blog, email newsletter, and social media accounts.</li></p>
                
                  <p><li> Make it easy for the buyer to purchase with a simple checkout process and the option to accept payment using PayPal, credit card, or weekly/monthly payment installments.</li></p>
                 
             <h5>Whatever you are going to sell, it must have the following:</h5>
             <h6><li>Great market viability</li></h6> 
             <p>A market that is “viable” is one that will continue being profitable for a long time, therefore helping your business to remain successful. Will there be a need for your product or service in many years to come?</p>
             <h6><li>Competitive advantage</li></h6>
             <p>What does your product or service have that will allow you to outperform your competitors? What will you do better than them and how?</p>
             <h6><li>Active target audience</li></h6>
             <p>Are there people currently searching for what your product or service offers? Does your product or service target a niche, yet large enough audience to generate plenty of sales?</p>
             <h6><li>Fits within legal requirements</li></h6>   
             <p>Do you have the licenses, permits, or certification required to run your business and sell your product or service? This brings us to our next section…</p>
            
            
              

             <h3>3. Conduct online market research</h3>
             <p>When you conduct online market research, you are simply gathering information about the market you will be entering into, as well as your competitors and customers. <br>
              <br>

              This is an essential step in starting your online business, as it helps you to determine if there’s a healthy demand for what you plan to sell. <br>
              <br>
              
              When we talk about demand, it refers to:</p> 
             <p><li>The need for your product/service/know-how</li></p>

             <p><li>Who wants to purchase what you’re selling</li></p> 
              
              <p><li>How much customers are willing to spend</li></p> 
             
             <h5>SERPs (Search engine results pages)</h5>
             <p>SERPs refers to Search Engine Results Pages, which are the pages displayed by search engines like Google when you type in a search term. <br>
              <br>

              You can analyze the top ranking websites to see what type of websites are in the first page of results. Are they:</p> 
              <p><li>Informational blogs? </li></p>

              <p><li>   E-commerce sites? </li></p>
                
              <p><li> Educational websites? </li></p>
              <p>This helps you understand if your chosen keywords have the correct intent for what your business will offer. </p>
             
              <h5>Competitors</h5>
              <p>Researching your competitors (those who offer a similar product or service to you) helps you to collect important information regarding their website and online business in general. By using a free tool such as SimilarWeb, you can easily see how much traffic the competitor website brings, what type of keywords they are ranking for, and more. <br>
                <br>

                Here are some of the things you should understand about your competitors when doing this research: </p>
               
               <p><li>Products/services</li></p> 

               <p><li>   Customers</li></p> 
                
               <p><li>   Pricing</li></p> 
                
               <p><li>   How they carry out business </li></p> 
              
            <h6>This competitor research then allows you to spot any potential gaps in the market that your business can fill.</h6>
            <h3>4. Find a profitable niche</h3>
            <p>A niche is a very focused business area of a broader market. A business that only sells clothing for newborn babies, for example, is a specialized niche within the broader fashion market.</p>
            <h5>Important benefits of having a niche business include:</h5>
            <p><li>Less competition in a smaller, more specialized market, giving you a better opportunity to stand out</li></p>   
            <p><li>The ability to offer niche market expertise, as well as a specialized skillset and knowledge base</li></p>
            <p><li>The potential to price your products or services higher as you have less competition, yet healthy demand</li></p>
            <p><li>Greater customer loyalty, retention, and satisfaction, as you’re meeting a very specific need in a smaller market</li></p>
            <p><li>Differentiation from competitors serving a more general market</li></p>
           
           <p>You also need your niche to be profitable to guarantee the success of your home-based, online business.</p>
           <h5>To find your profitable niche:          </h5> 
           <p><li>Focus on an area you are knowledgeable and passionate about (think back to your “skills map”)</li></p>
           <p><li>Identify subtopics within this area and research each one</li></p>
           <p><li>Analyze the target audiences within these areas and think about their needs and wants to identify potential gaps in the marketplace </li></p>
           <p><li>Research if this sector is evergreen, or has consistent interest over time. To determine this, perform a Google search for the fastest growing industries by revenue growth in your country or use Google Trends.</li></p>
          
          <h3>5. Define your target audience</h3>
          <p>Your target audience is a group of individuals sharing similar characteristics or needs that your online business is aiming to serve. Therefore, they are most likely to purchase your products or services. <br>
            <br>

            The easiest way to define your target audience is to segment them based on demographics. Going back to SimilarWeb, you can have a general overview of your competitor's target audience and start to gather information such as: </p>
           
           <h6>Age</h6> 
           <p><li>How old are they?</li></p>

           <p><li>    What generation are they part of?</li></p>
          
          <h6>Gender</h6> 
          <p><li>Are they predominantly male or female?</li></p>

          <h6>Income</h6>
          <p><li>How much money do they make per year?</li></p>

          <p><li> Within what income class do they belong?</li></p>
         
         <h6>Device Use</h6>
         <p><li>How do they consume content?</li></p> 
         <p><li>Desktop?</li></p> 
         <p><li>Mobile?</li></p> 
         <p><li>Tablet?</li></p> 
         <h3>6. Source products to sell online</h3>
         <p>Your products are the foundation of your online business, so you’ll want to put a lot of thought into the way you source them. There are three main ways to source products: <br>
          <br>

          1. to make them yourself <br>
          
          2. to work with a manufacturer or wholesaler <br>
          
         
         <h5>DIY products </h5>
         <p>If you're making DIY products, such as handcrafted necklaces, wall art, or knitted scarves, your first task will be sourcing the materials required to make your products. Identify what materials are needed to create your desired product, then research their costs online or by visiting a store. <br>
          <br>

          Popular places for sourcing materials for DIY products include:</p> 
         
          <p>1. Local flea markets <br>

            2. Craft stores <br>
            
            3. Estate sales <br>
            
            4. An established retailer <br>
            
            5. Friends and family</p>
           
           <h5>Work with a manufacturer or wholesaler</h5>
           <p>Working with a manufacturer or wholesaler allows you to hire a partner to develop the product on your behalf. This option may be useful if you:</p>
           <p><li>Can't make the product yourself, due to a lack of skills, tools, or equipment necessary</li></p> 
           <p><li>Are ready to scale your DIY product by hiring a team or other company to make it for you</li></p>
           <p><li>Are experiencing higher than planned sales and need additional products to be produced quickly</li></p>
           <p>Working with a manufacturer or wholesaler offers benefits for your online business, including:</p>
           <p><li>The option to pursue a unique or complex product idea without having to make it yourself</li></p>
           <p><li>The ability to source products which have already proven to be popular</li></p>
           <p><li>Still having full control over your brand and the quality of your product</li></p>
           <p><li>Assistance with production from those with manufacturing experience</li></p>
           <p>Sourcing your product from a manufacturer or wholesaler may require you to invest more heavily upfront than if you were to produce the product yourself, however.</p>
           <p>So, where do you find the products, or ideas for products, that you want to make and sell?</p>
           <p><li>Partner with a friend or family member who makes a product you’d like to sell</li></p>
           <p><li>Source a product using wholesale websites such as Amazon, Flipkart, or Paytm Mall</li></p>
           <p><li>Partner with an existing business to take their products online or from B2B to B2C</li></p>
           <p><li>Build relationships with makers on social media</li></p>
          
          <h3>7. Questions for a wholesaler</h3>
          <p>The following important questions will help you determine if a wholesale company is right for your online business:</p>
          <h5>Production and shipping</h5>
          <p>1. Where are the products made? <br>

            2. What location are the products shipped from?<br>
            
           3. What will the total cost of production and shipping be? Are there any potential hidden fees?<br>
            
            4. How long will it take for them to create, fulfill, and ship the product?</p>
           
           <h5>Minimum order quantities</h5>
           <p>1. Will you have to commit to a certain number of units or spend a minimum amount?</p>
           
           <h5>Terms and conditions</h5>
           <p>1. What does the contract entail? <br>

            2. Is there any wiggle room for things your business or customers need? <br>
            
            3. Is there an evaluation period or terms for termination? <br>
            
            4. What are the payment terms? <br>
            
            5. What are your return or refund policies? <br>
            
            6. Do you have liability insurance? <br>
            
            7. Does the product have or require certifications?</p>
           
           <h3>8. Evaluate product viability</h3>
           <p>We all know some products have greater potential to sell than others, but how can you determine if your own products will have that same success? <br>
            <br>

            The best trending e-commerce products all have three important characteristics in common:</p> 
            <h6><li>Unique, authentic and eye-catching</li></h6>
            <p>The product you’re selling should be one-of-a-kind so the demand for it is high. Ideally, customers shouldn’t be able to purchase your product anywhere else online.</p>
           
            <h6><li>Difficult to find</li></h6>
            <p>When a product is unique, it is also usually more difficult to find. This increases customer demand for your product, yet means you have little to no competition when it comes to selling it, setting you up for success.

            </p>

            <h6><li>Lower pricing </li></h6>
            <p>The ideal product will be one that you can sell within a good profit margin, and this is where adopting a drop-shipping solution becomes challenging as you will have to increase your prices. Is it bad? That's not ideal but if you don't overdue you might actually increase the customer’s perceived value of the product</p>
            <h3>9. Factors to consider before you sell</h3>
            <h5>How long do your products take to make?</h5>
            <p>If you are making DIY products, will you make your items to order or keep inventory on hand so the product can be shipped immediately? <br>
              <br>

              If you’re working with a dropshipper or wholesaler, you will need to understand their policies and ensure they always have enough products on hand to keep up with your demand. If they need to order or make products to fulfill your requests, how long will it take to restock? </p>
             
             <h5>How will you ship orders?</h5>
             <p>If your product is a digital one, then delivering orders to your customers can be set up on autopilot through your e-commerce platform, allowing them to gain access to the files once payment has been made. <br>

              Physical products, on the other hand, will require shipping to buyers, so you need to determine which method is easier and more affordable.  <br>
              
              For DIY products, will you visit the post office and send the parcels yourself? <br>
              
              If you're working with a wholesaler, will you ship products yourself or work with a shipping and fulfillment company? <br>
              
              If you're using a dropshipper, they will handle all the shipping and fulfillment for you. </p> 
             
             <h5>“Gentlemen, the officer who doesn’t know his communications and supply as well his tactics is totally useless”</h5>
             
             <h3>10. Define your brand identity</h3>
             <h5>Implement design and UI/UX</h5>
             <p>When defining your brand identity, it’s important that you focus on design features such as your:</p>
             <p><li>Logo</li></p>
             <p><li>Color scheme</li></p>
             <p><li>Typography</li></p>
             <p><li>Font</li></p>
             <p><li>Graphics / photography</li></p>
             <p>Along with graphic design, other important elements of your visual identity include UX (user experience) and UI (user interface) design.</p>
             <p>A UX designer considers the user’s entire journey to solve a particular problem. For example, what steps do they need to take in order to make a purchase? They focus on the overall feel of a user’s experience when interacting with your brand.</p>
             <p>A UI designer, on the other hand, considers all the visual and interactive elements of a product interface, including buttons, icons, spacing, and responsive design. It’s also their job to make sure the design is consistent, coherent, and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
             <h5>Choose the right e-commerce platform for your business</h5>
             <p>An e-commerce platform can be thought of as the central hub for your online business. <br>
              <br>

              When determining which e-commerce platform is right for your business, you’ll want to make sure it offers the following:</p>
              <p><li>The ability to sell an unlimited amount of products, including both physical and digital products</li></p>
              <p><li>Basic built-in e-commerce features including promotions and discounts, analytics, and catalog management.</li></p>
              <p><li>An e-commerce website builder that is cost-efficient, easy-to-use, and mobile-responsive</li></p>
              <p><li>Security features, such as secure payment processors</li></p>
              <p><li>SEO-friendly features, such as the ability to have a custom domain name, meta tags, meta descriptions, SEO optimized URL structures, and more</li></p>
              <h5>Develop content guidelines </h5>
              <p>Your content is how you communicate with your customers, engage with your target audience, and portray your business professionally. <br>
                <br>

                Therefore, it’s important you determine the following content-related elements for your brand:</p>
                <h6>Copy guidelines</h6>
                <p>This set of rules should outline what to do and what not to do when writing content associated with your online business. It should also focus on:</p>
                <p><li>Grammar rules</li></p>

                <p><li> How to format text</li></p>
                  
                <p><li> What words should and shouldn’t be used in association with your brand</li></p>
               
              <h6>Tone of voice</h6>
              <p>This isn’t about what you say, but rather how you say it. <br>
                <br>

                Think of your online business as having a certain personality, then determine how this can be communicated through your words and what sort of impression you want to have on your audience. <br>
                <br>
                
                For example, will your tone of voice be formal and professional, young and trendy, or friendly and conversational?</p>  
               
               <h6>Mission statement</h6> 
               <p>This is a summary of the aims and values of your company. When writing your mission statement, you should think about:</p>
               <p><li>Why your online business exists</li></p>

               <p><li> What your overall goals are</li></p>
                
               <p><li>  The products or services you provide</li></p>
                
               <p><li> Your target audience</li></p>
                
               <p><li>  The geographical location in which you operate</li></p>
