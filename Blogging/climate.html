                            <h6>Researchers can now spot climate change’s role in extreme weather.</h6>
                            <p>Attribution of recent climate change is the effort to scientifically ascertain mechanisms responsible for recent global warming and related climate changes on Earth. The effort has focused on changes observed during the period of instrumental temperature record, particularly in the last 50 years. This is the period when human activity has grown fastest and observations of the atmosphere above the surface have become available. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it is "extremely likely"[5] that human influence was the dominant cause of global warming between 1951 and 2010. Likely human contribution is 93%–123% of the observed 1951–2010 temperature change.</p>
                            <h4>Scientific Underpinnings</h4>
								<p>Since the onset of the Industrial Revolution more than two centuries ago, human activities—
									especially fossil fuel combustion, land use change, and industrial production—have dramatically
									impacted earth’s climate. As a result of human activities, concentrations of radiatively important
									agents such as GHGs and aerosols have increased significantly. Carbon dioxide (CO2)
									concentrations, for example, have increased by more than 40 percent to levels not seen in at least
									3 million years. These changes in atmospheric chemistry have triggered widespread warming and
									other impacts. Global surface air temperature has increased by approximately 1.8° F, and ocean
									heat content has increased by approximately 33.5 ± 7.0 × 1022 joules.
									18 As the planet has warmed,
									Arctic sea ice volume has decreased by more than 50 percent, mass loss from land-based ice sheets
									has accelerated, and sea levels have risen by approximately 1 foot. Warming is also leading to
									phenological changes, such as longer growing seasons, and impacting all human and natural
									systems. The frequency, intensity and duration of many types of extreme events are changing
									dramatically as well. For example, record breaking high temperatures are now far more common
									than record breaking low temperatures, high water levels on coastlines are increasing dramatically,
									and the frequency of hydrometeorological extremes—both droughts and floods—is also increasing
									in many regions.
									</p>
									<h4>Weather types</h4>
									<p>Combining the evidence over the past 20 years, the literature is heavily dominated by studies of extreme heat (35%), rainfall or flooding (19%) and drought (17%). Together, these make up more than two-thirds of all published studies (72%). </p>
									<p>As the chart below shows, the number of events studied each year has grown substantially over the past decade. Note that formal studies typically follow a year or so after the event itself as the writing and peer-review process for journal papers can take many months.</p>
									<p>The majority of studies included here have been published in the annual “Explaining extreme events” special issues of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society (BAMS). Each bumper volume typically contains around 20-30 peer-reviewed studies of events from the previous year. Other studies have been found through the Climate Signals database and online searches through journals. This update includes studies published up to the end of 2019.</p>

								<h4>Human influence</h4>
								<p>Turning to the results of the attribution studies that have been published so far, scientists found that human-caused climate change has altered the likelihood or severity of an extreme weather event in 78% of cases studied (69% made more severe or likely and 9% made less so). <br>
									<br>

									In Carbon Brief’s first edition of this analysis in 2017, 68% of events were found to have a human impact (with 63% made more severe or likely and 6% less so).</p>
								
								<p>For the majority of events affected by climate change, the balance has shifted in the same direction. That is, rising temperatures made the event in question more severe or more likely to occur. These events are represented by the red in the chart below. Clicking on the red “slice” reveals that heatwaves account for 47% of such events, droughts for 15% and rainfall or flooding for 15%. Return to the original chart, and do the same with the other slices to see the proportion of different weather types in each category.</p>
								<div class="featured">
									<figure>
										<img src="img/blog-img/climate2.png">
										
									</figure>
								</div>
								<p>In 11% of extreme weather events and trends studied, scientists found no discernible influence from human activity. These are coloured blue in the map and the chart above. For a further 12%, the observational data or modelling techniques used in the study were insufficient to reach a reliable conclusion (shown as grey in the map and pie chart). <br>
									<br>

									In 9% of studied weather events and trends, scientists found climate change had made the event less likely or less severe (pale orange in the chart above).</p>
								
								<h4>Heatwaves</h4>
								<p>Of the 125 attribution studies that have looked at extreme heat around the world, 116 (93%) found that climate change had made such an event more likely or more severe. No studies found a heatwave had been made less severe by climate change, while two studies (2%) identified no influence and a further seven (6%) were inconclusive.</p>
								<p>Another important point is that in cases where attribution science finds that climate change is making a given type of extreme weather more likely, it does not necessarily follow that the chance of experiencing that kind of weather gets incrementally higher each year. Natural variability means that there will still be ups and downs in the strength and frequency of extreme events. <br>
									<br>

									Finally, there is usually a level of confidence attached to attribution results. So, while two studies might both find a role for human influence in a given weather event, the signal may be stronger for one than the other. For the purposes of this analysis, the attribution map does not distinguish between high- and low-confidence results, but users can click through to each study for more details.</p>	
								
							<h4>Heavy rain and flooding</h4>
							<p>Of the 68 studies to look at rainfall or flooding, 37 (54%) found human activity had made the event more likely or more severe – a far smaller proportion than for heat-related studies. Six studies (9%) found that climate change had made the whole event less likely to occur. Of the remaining studies on heavy rainfall, 15 (22%) found no evidence of a link to climate change while 10 (15%) were inconclusive. <br>
								<br>

								That there is a more divided set of results for extreme rainfall than for heatwaves could suggest several things. In some cases, limited data might make it difficult to detect a clear “signal” of climate change above the “noise” of weather considered normal for a particular region. In other cases, an inconclusive result could reflect the fact that rainfall or flooding events are inherently more complex than heatwaves, with many ways for natural variability to play a role. Human factors, such as land use and drainage, also play a part in whether heavy rain leads to flooding.</p>

							<h4>An evolving science</h4>
							<p>As the science of extreme event attribution has matured and become more nuanced, so has the choice of terminology around extreme weather and climate change.</p>
							<p>But while it would be premature to suggest that any single study is the last word, it is clear that – in many cases – the science can do better than that. Similarly, scientific thinking has clearly moved on from the unsatisfactory statement that it is not possible to attribute any individual weather event to climate change.</p>
							<p>Ultimately, there are no blanket rules in attribution. Scientists need to examine the circumstances of each individual weather event – or a longer pattern of events for trend studies. It is only by combining evidence from all around the world that they can begin to draw broader conclusions. </p>
