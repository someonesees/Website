                            <p>Gaming industry in India is all set to grow with modern technologies like artificial intelligence bound to revolutionize the gaming experience.

                                <br>
                                To cite a study conducted by KPMG, the number of game development companies in India today stands at around 275. This number was a mere 25 in the year 2010. This number alone speaks volumes about the growth and possibilities of the gaming industry in India.

                            </p>

                            <h4>What is Game Development?</h4>
                            <p>In its simplest form, game development is the process of making a video game. <br>
                                <br>

                                You take an idea or a concept for a game, and you develop, program, engineer, render, record, mix, produce, test, etc. until you have a full-fledged game.</p>
                            <h5>More pieces of the picture:</h5>
                            <p>The popularity of the video game development field is booming. It’s grown quite a bit in the past 10+ years. <br>
                                <br>

                                There are a number of reasons for this. Some of the obvious ones are the continued growth of the gaming industry. As video games become more accessible and gain a bigger following, more people consider participating in what goes on behind the scenes. <br>
                                <br>
                                
                                Another reason: probably the internet. Everything is so accessible! Including tutorials, games, and articles talking about how fun it is to be a successful indie games developer.</p>	
                            
                            <p>Also, depending on your age, you might blame millennials for the game dev boom. (zing!) <br>
                                <br>

                                The popularity boom means more opportunities to learn, as college educators rush to satisfy the demand and hoard your gold (while you rake in dat debt). It also means more competition as you’re now in a pool of thousands of like-minded students hoping to nap the “golden ticket” that is a degree in game development.</p>	
                            
                             *Timeout* <br>
                             <br>
                             <p>Here’s the truth–you don’t need to go to college. There are other options. And just because you go to college doesn’t mean you’re getting the “golden ticket.” In fact, there’s only one place we’ve seen a golden ticket actually work, and it’s in Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory. (Technically…two places we’ve seen it work, since, you know…remakes.)</p>

                        <h4>Game Development vs Game Design</h4>
                        <p>It’s true, game design and game development are different things. Sometimes you’ll see them used interchangeably. Here’s a reason why: <br>
                            <br>

                            On a small team, you’ll have people dipping hands into the design and the development side. Game Development encompasses both game design and game development. That’s why sometimes game studios are called game developers. It’s kind of like the rectangle/square debate. <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            So, this isn’t the hard and fast rule, but it’s a decent rule of thumb to work from: <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            Game design deals with the conceptual side of things. Designers come up with the initial vision for a game. The mechanics, the core concepts, the aesthetics, the characters, levels, narratives–these elements tend to fall under the scope of game design. <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            Game development involves bringing these ideas to life. Developers take games from the conceptual phase, through *development*, and into reality. <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            A game developer can refer to a single person/occupation, or to describe a whole game studio. <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            The development side of games typically involves the programming, coding, rendering, engineering, and testing of the game (and all of its elements: sound, levels, characters, and other assets, etc.). <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            You (kind of) know the difference…but what kind of roles can you expect as a game developer?</p>	 
                        
                        <h4>Stages of Video Game Development</h4>
                        <p>“I want to be a game developer where do I start” – I hear you crying out. Well, it starts from nothing, essentially. You need to make sure that you have a reliable team of artists, programmers, and more. <br>
                            <br>

                            Here are the following stages of game development, and the best ways of learning game development (step by step).</p>	
                            <h6>Step 1: High Concept</h6>
                            <p>The first major step in how to develop a game is the high concept. This is a general idea. It’s a very brief description where you try to distill your ideas down to a few sentences</p>
                            <h6>Step 2: Pitch</h6>
                            <p>This is the big one. You pitch your idea in a summarized form to best communicate ideas and their goals. It’s also a time to promote why it would be a prudent idea to develop financially and commercially.</p>
                            <h6>Step 3: Concept</h6>
                            <p>Further along, this is the lovechild between the high concept and pitch. This is where you outline and describe all of the aspects of the game. We’re talking story, demographics, risk analysis and a boatload of further information.</p>
                            <h6>Step 4: Game Design Document</h6>
                            <p>This document includes aspects tied to actual gameplay and may include prototypical aspects of your project.</p>
                            <h6>Step 5: Prototype</h6>
                            <p>This is where you and your team can shine early on. Building the prototype will allow you to develop the methods in which you’ll fully execute your idea. It’s a good way to build a proof of concept, adapting your goals into a more tangible form.</p>
                            <h6>Step 6: Production</h6>
                            <li>Design</li>
                            <li>Level Creation</li>
                            <li>Programming</li>
                            <br>
                            <p>This is when the ball starts to roll. Things like sound and early graphical assets begin to be implemented. The game is lifted off of the ground and finally starts to take shape. This is where programming comes into the game development process.</p>
         
                            <blockquote class="mb-30">
                                <h6> "A lot of indie developers who became 'Overnight Successes' were working at it for ten years."
                                    
                                    </h6>

                        <h5>The ecosystem of the gaming industry in India</h5>
                        <p>It was in the early 90s that India was exposed for the first time to gaming. Hand-held gaming consoles became a craze. But that apart, the trend did not pick up the pace one would have anticipated. Installing games on desktops, which anyway were a rarity and the pricing of PlayStations and Xbox made it a very niche trend. <br>
                            <br>

                            Fast forward a couple of decades and the country has already witnessed the smartphone uprising. Almost 40% of the country now has access to smartphones. This number is increasing by a healthy rate of over 12% annually. Coupled with the data revolution in the country, led by Reliance Jio, games are now available at the tap of a screen, with almost no costs attached – thus giving a much-needed fillip to the online gaming industry. <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            With India having the world’s largest youth population and second-largest internet population it makes the country one of the world’s leading markets in the gaming sector. There are over 22.2 crore gamers in India who spend an average of 42 minutes per day on mobile games.</p>	
                        <h5>The current scenario</h5>
                        <p>Over the last decade, especially in the last 5-6 years, Facebook games like Farmville and Candy Crush have been a rage. Games like Clash of Clans and most recently PUBG, have caught the imagination of the young Indian crowd – extracting hours at length on the interface. The in-app purchases in these games present the developers with great financial viability. <br>
                            <br>

                            NASSCOM data suggests that India’s mobile games market will be worth $1.1 billion by 2020, and number of users projected to become 628 million by then. With this increased headroom for growth, major players in the gaming industry are more willing to invest a substantial amount in the country. Industry big-wigs like Alibaba and AGTech Holdings have already invested in the market. Tencent too has evaluated its opportunities in India. StomStudio partnered with mobile game publisher Gamesbond to create mobile games in India. <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            Action-based games have seen a surge of more than 427% when it comes to the total time spent on the games. The in-app purchases have gone up by 241%. Casual games have seen a surge in the total time spent by 84% and 66% respectively. However, in-app purchases in casual games have gone up by 125% whereas it has come down by 6% in casino games. The time and monies spent on strategy games have been stagnant with a marginal increase.</p>	
                        <h5></h5>	
                        <p>Cloud gaming presents a massive market opportunity that prolongs beyond interactive entertainment. Web giants like Google, Microsoft and Amazon are already gunning for the share of the business and have already offered, or are in the process of offering products that are built to catch the fancy of the Indian youth. Gaming, in fact, remains the fastest growing sector for monetization even for Google. <br>
                            <br>

                            The constant need for improvement and competition between gaming companies will also give Artificial Intelligence a promising future, in the gaming world. Artificial Intelligence would not only provide an improved gaming experience but also aid in providing high-quality games at lower budgets. <br>
                            <br>
                            Given the fact that the average Indian smartphone user is still not very comfortable with the idea of large in-app purchases, it would be crucial for companies to test waters with micro-payments. As of now, all the elements are indicative of a very bright future for the gaming industry in India – a captive target audience, the rise in disposable income, synchronized industry efforts and an ecosystem that is extremely conducive to growth. An increase in investment opportunities in the gaming market has led it to increase at the rate of two gaming startups monthly. At such a fast pace, 2020 is deemed to be the ‘Year of Gaming’ in India. It is no longer a question of “how would the industry boom” but “When will the industry boom”?</p>
