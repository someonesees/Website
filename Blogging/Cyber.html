                            <p>In any discussion on cyber incident response & resilience, it is imperative to deliberate upon the subject of threat actors. After all, if you can’t identify who could potentially harm your business, how will you anticipate the kind and scale of damage they can cause? <br>
                            </p>
                            <p>In this blog, we cover: <br>
                                <br>

                                What/who are your threat actors? <br>
                                Why is understanding your threat actors imperative for good CIPR? <br>
                                Common threat actor types <br>
                                Threat actor attributes <br>
                                </p>
                                <h3>What/who are threat actors?</h3>
								<p>As the name suggests, threat actors or agents can be any individual/ group that is capable of causing harm to your business and data security. Their inherent ability to cause harm, despite what their intentions may be, justifies the tag ‘threat actors’ and it is advisable to stick to one uniform term when discussing such agents instead of creating too many verbal categorizations. <br>
									<br>

									While this blog aims to offer a surface-level understanding of the importance of knowing one’s threat actors, Cyber Management Alliance's NCSC-Certified Cyber Incident Response & Planning Course delves into the subject deeply and will help the management and technical teams agree on a threat library.  In fact, our module on Threat Actors is currently available free of charge on our training platform. You can click on the link below to access this free module and get an in-depth understanding of who your potential business adversaries can be. 

								</p>
								 <h3>Why is understanding your threat actors imperative for good CIPR?</h3> 
								 <p>Quite simply, if you don’t know who your threat actors are, you’ll not be able to get any clarity on their motivations, their modus operandi, their capabilities or what assets they may be after. <br>
									<br>

									Further, clearly identifying the threat agents will allow you to effectively allocate resources (budgets and time) to the most relevant risks and threats. <br>
									<br>
									
									So how do you go about enlisting your threat actors? The idea is to have the technology and management teams reach a consensus about who the possible threat actors are and what their attributes are like. This simple exercise on its own can be a huge step forward in enabling everyone to better understand the business’s threat landscape and build a solid response strategy.</p>

								<h3>Common threat actor types</h3>
								<br>
								<p> Hacktivists <br>
									Cyber-criminals <br>
									Disgruntled insiders<br>
									Careless employees <br>
									Nation states</p>
								
								<h3>Threat Actor Attributes</h3>
								<p>Enlisting the threat actors, however, isn’t enough and the organisation will need to evaluate their attributes to correctly assess the threat to the business. A cursory understanding of attributes can be gathered on the basis of the following considerations:</p>
								<br>
								<p>1. Intent - Depending on whether a threat actor harms the business intentionally or accidentally, he/she is classified as a hostile or a non-hostile agent, respectively.</p>
								<br>
								<p>2. Access – This refers to whether the threat actor had internal access or was able to gain access externally.</p>
								<br>
								<p>3. Skill Level – This classification is based on the skill level of the threat actor and can range from ‘none’ to ‘adept’.</p>
								<br>
								<p>4. Resources - This determines the resources available to the agent for use in an attack.</p>
								<br>
								<p>5. Visibility – Visibility refers to the extent to which the agent wishes to reveal his/her identity.</p>
								<br>
								<p>6. Objective – As the name suggests, here we try to identify the objective of what the threat actor is doing - is it to make a copy of an asset, destroy it, take control of it or if the agent has no defined motive at all?</p>
								<br>
								<p>7. Outcome – Outcome means the primary goal of the attack. It can range from theft or gaining a competitive market advantage to simply causing embarrassment to the business. In many cases, if the threat actor is non-hostile the outcome could be totally unintentional.</p>
								<br>
								<p>These classifications and considerations offer a preliminary understanding of the vast and highly relevant subject of Threat Actors.</p>	

								<h3>What really happens during a cyber-attack and how the damage can be mitigated</h3>
								<h4>1. Mistakes are & will be made</h4>
								<p>This is stating the obvious and the unavoidable. In a state of panic induced by the attack, decisions are made in a rush. Facts aren’t communicated clearly with key stakeholders and too many times businesses that have been under attack have failed to inform regulators in time, leading to hefty fines and loss of business reputation. All of these mistakes cannot be avoided because your incident response team is made up of humans and human beings make mistakes when under pressure.
									<br>
									But what can be avoided is the Headless Chicken Syndrome that often manifests itself in the chaos and confusion that follow an attack. This syndrome and its effects can, indeed, be mitigated to a large degree and the number of mistakes can be reduced if your team is trained well. If you have a solid incident response plan in place and have incident response playbooks to fall back upon, chances are that inadvertent and careless mistakes during an attack will be reduced and your staff will know, at least at the onset, what they should and shouldn’t do.

								</p>
								<h4>2. Sanctity of Evidence.. Wait, What Evidence?</h4>
								<p>The most common problem that emerges in incident response is the deletion of evidence. Vital evidence of the attack and how it took place is often deleted – either on purpose or accidentally. Integrity of evidence is sacrosanct to effective incident response. It helps the IT and security team understand the attack methodology, figure out what can be done to control it from spiralling out of hand and also for preventing similar situations from recurring in the future. Evidence is also essential to regulatory compliance for reporting the attack correctly. Evidence, therefore, must never be tampered with, under any circumstances. The only way to achieve this is to have regular training that makes preserving evidence second nature in times of a crisis and having a Cyber Incident Response Checklist that every member of the response team is so familiar with that it becomes a part of their muscle memory.  </p>

								<h4>3. Facts are Nowhere to be Found! </h4>
								<p>In the aftermath of an attack, everyone is clamouring for FACTS but NONE are usually available. It is debilitating to not be able to know the impact on the business and/or not being able to rapidly identify the impact on the data subjects (ref. GDPR and breach notification). It is also essential to know if the data was encrypted and who has access to it. Facts (1)While knowing everything may not always be possible immediately after an attack, it is important to record all the facts on physical writing devices! The chain of events during the attack, any new facts that are emerging during triage must be mapped, but not on an electronic system that is already compromised.   </p>

								<h4>4. Communication - Major Headache </h4>
								<p>Inconsistent communications are another oft-seen byproduct of a cyber-attack. Due to the charged emotions, the mayhem and the chaos, communication threads in a crisis start to be coloured and corrupted with prejudices and personal notions. This must be avoided at all cost as apart from further adding to confusion, unclear communications can have legal repercussions.  <br>
									<br>

									The only solution to this challenge is a clear-cut crisis communications strategy. This strategy shouldn’t just enlist what steps to take and whom to communicate with, but it must also lucidly define the taxonomy to be used and ban words that create further confusion and are misleading. Crisis communications is an imperative and very essential aspect of cyber incident response training. Any staff member who will play the lead role in crisis communications with stakeholders and the media must be thoroughly trained in this aspect, while all other team members must also be given basic orientation.</p>
								
								<h4>5. Did anyone say Mental Health? </h4>
								<p>It’s easy to forget that a crisis for the business is also a crisis for the staff – a serious mental and emotional challenge that can have far-reaching ramifications. Remember that when your employees are at their most vulnerable that they’re also most likely to make mistakes.
									<br>
									If you want to save your business more damage than it has already suffered, make your employees’ mental health a priority. Don’t blame anyone. Don’t admonish anyone in public for the attack. Show appreciation for those who have displayed patience and agility in dealing with the attack. Those who are clearly under severe pressure must be encouraged to take time off. Mental health of your staff must never be made collateral damage in a cyber-attack.
								</p>
