                            <p>Trust is a critical factor in cloud computing; in present practice it depends largely on perception of reputation, and self assessment by providers of cloud services. We begin this paper with a survey of existing mechanisms for establishing trust, and comment on their limitations. We then address those limitations by proposing more rigorous mechanisms based on evidence, attribute certification, and validation, and conclude by suggesting a framework for integrating various trust mechanisms together to reveal chains of trust in the cloud.</p>
                            <h4>What is cloud computing?</h4>
                            <p>Cloud computing is a term used to describe the use of hardware and software delivered via network (usually the Internet). The term comes from the use of cloud shaped symbol that represents abstraction of rather complex infrastructure that enables the work of software, hardware, computation and remote services. <br>
                                <br>

                                Simply put, cloud computing is computing based on the internet. In the past, people would run applications or programs from software downloaded on a physical computer or server in their building. Cloud computing allows people access to the same kinds of applications through the internet. <br>
                                <br>
                                
                                Cloud computing is based on the premise that the main computing takes place on a machine, often remote, that is not the one currently being used. Data collected during this process is stored and processed by remote servers (also called cloud servers). This means the device accessing the cloud doesn't need to work as hard. <br>
                                <br>
                                
                                By hosting software, platforms, and databases remotely, the cloud servers free up the memory and computing power of individual computers. Users can securely access cloud services using credentials received from the cloud computing provider.</p>
                            <p>Cloud computing has become a prominent paradigm of computing and IT service delivery. However, for any potential user of cloud services, they will ask “can I trust this cloud service?” Furthermore, what exactly does “trust” mean in the context of cloud computing? What is the basis of that trust? If the attributes of a cloud service (or a service provider) are used as evidence for trust judgment on the service (or provider respectively), on what basis should users believe the attributes claimed by cloud providers? Who are authorities to monitor, measure, assess, or validate cloud attributes? The answers to those questions are essential for wide adoption of cloud computing and for cloud computing to evolve into a trustworthy computing paradigm. As addressed in [1], “the growing importance of cloud computing makes it increasingly imperative that we grapple with the meaning of trust in the cloud and how the customer, provider, and society in general establish that trust.”</p>	

                            <h4>Cloud computing benefits</h4>
                            <p>Here's a list of key benefits an enterprise can expect to achieve when adopting cloud infrastructure.</p>
                            <h6>1. Efficiency / cost reduction</h6>
                            <p>By using cloud infrastructure, you don't have to spend huge amounts of money on purchasing and maintaing equipment. This drastically reduces capex costs. You don’t have to invest in hardware, facilities, utilities, or building out a large data center to grow your business. You do not even need large IT teams to handle your cloud data center operations, as you can enjoy the expertise of your cloud provider’s staff. <br>
                                <br>

                                Cloud also reduces costs related to downtime. Since downtime is rare in cloud systems, this means you don't have to spend time and money on fixing potential issues related to downtime.</p>
                            <h6>2. Data security</h6>
                            <p>One of the major concerns of every business, regardless of size and industry, is the security of its data. Data breaches and other cybercrimes can devastate a company's revenue, customer loyalty and brand positioning. <br>
                                <br>

                                Cloud offers many advanced security features that guarantee that data is securely stored and handled. <br>
                                <br>
                                
                                Cloud storage providers implement baseline protections for their platforms and the data they process, such authentication, access control, and encryption. From there, most enterprises supplement these protections with added security measures of their own to bolster cloud data protection and tighten access to sensitive information in the cloud.</p>	
                            
                            <h6>3. Scalability</h6>
                            <p>Different companies have different IT needs -- a large enterprise of 1000+ employees won't have the same IT requirements as a start-up.Using cloud is a great solution because it enables enterprise to efficiently -- and quickly -- scale up/down their IT departments, according to business demands. <br>
                                <br>

                                Cloud based solutions are ideal for businesses with growing or fluctuating bandwidth demands. If your business demands increase, you can easily increase your cloud capacity without having to invest in physical infrastructure. This level of agility can give businesses using cloud computing a real advantage over competitors. <br>
                                <br>
                                
                                This scalability minimizes the risks associated with in-house operational issues and maintenance. You have high-performance resources at your disposal with professional solutions and zero up-front investment. Scalability is probably the greatest advantage of the cloud.</p>	
                            
                            <h6>4. Mobility</h6>
                            <p>Cloud computing allows mobile access to corporate data via smartphones and devices, which is a great way to ensure that no one is ever left out of the loop. Staff with busy schedules, or who live a long way away from the corporate office, can use this feature to keep instantly up-to-date with clients and coworkers. <br>
                                <br>

                                Resources in the cloud can be easily stored, retrieved, recovered, or processed with just a couple of clicks. Users can get access to their works on-the-go, 24/7, via any devices of their choice, in any corner of the world as long as you stay connected to the internet. On top of that, all the upgrades and updates are done automatically, off-sight by the service providers. This saves time and team effort in maintaining the systems, tremendously reducing the IT team workloads.</p>	
                            <h6>5. Disaster recovery</h6>
                            <p>Data loss is a major concern for all organizations, along with data security. Storing your data in the cloud guarantees that data is always available, even if your equipment like laptops or PCs, is damaged. Cloud-based services provide quick data recovery for all kinds of emergency scenarios -- from natural disasters to power outages. <br>
                                <br>

                                Cloud infrastructure can also help you with loss prevention. If you rely on traditional on-premises approach, all your data will be stored locally, on office computers. Despite your best efforts, computers can malfunction from various reasons -- from malware and viruses, to age-related hardware deterioration, to simple user error. <br>
                                <br>
                                
                                But, if you upload your data to the cloud, it remains accesible for any computer with an internet connection, even if something happens to your work computer.</p>	
                            
                            <h6>6. Control</h6>
                            <p>Having control over sensitive data is vital to any company. You never know what can happen if a document gets into the wrong hands, even if it’s just the hands of an untrained employee. <br>
                                <br>

                                Cloud enables you complete visibility and control over your data. You can easily decide which users have what level of access to what data. This gives you control, but it also streamlines work since staff will easily know what documents are assigned to them. It will also increase and ease collaboration. Since one version of the document can be worked on by different people, and there's no need to have copies of the same document in circulation.</p>	
                            
                            <h6>7. Competitive edge</h6>
                            <p>Not every company will migrate to the cloud, at least not yet. However, organizations which adopt cloud find that many benefits that cloud offers positively impacts their business. <br>
                                <br>

                                Cloud adoption increases every year, since companies realize that it offers them access to world-class enterprise technology. And, if you implement a cloud solution now, you'll be ahead of your competitors.</p>	
                            
                            <h4>Semantics of trust</h4>
                            <p>The term “trust” is often loosely used in the literature on cloud trust, frequently as a general term for “security” and “privacy”, such as . What exactly does “trust” mean? <br>
                                <br>

                                Trust is a complex social phenomenon. Based on the concepts of trust developed in social sciences [15, 16], we use the following definition: <br>
                                <br>
                                
                                Trust is a mental state comprising: <br> expectancy - the trustor expects a specific behavior from the trustee (such as providing valid information or effectively performing cooperative actions); <br> belief - the trustor believes that the expected behavior occurs, based on the evidence of the trustee’s competence, integrity, and goodwill; <br> willingness to take risk - the trustor is willing to take risk for that belief. <br>
                                <br>
                                
                                It is important to understand that the expected behavior of trustee is beyond the trustor’s control; the trustor’s belief in that expected behavior of trustee is based on the trustee’s capability, goodwill (including intension or motivation), and integrity. The integrity of the trustee gives the trustor confidence about the predictability of the trustee’s behavior.</p>	
                            
                            <h4>Cloud transparency mechanisms</h4>
                            <p>Transparency and accountability are a recognized basis for gaining trust on cloud providers. To increase transparency of the cloud, the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) launched the “Security, Trust & Assurance Registry (STAR)” program, a free publicly accessible registry which allows cloud service providers to publish self-assessment of their security controls, in either a “Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ)” or a “Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM)”, which embody CSA published best practices. CAIQ contains over 140 questions which cloud users or auditors may ask; CCM is a framework describing how a cloud provider aligns with the CSA security guide. Examples of cloud providers’ self-assessments can be found at the CSA STAR website. STAR is a useful source for users seeking cloud services. However, the information offered is a cloud provider’s self-assessment; cloud users may want assessments performed by some independent third-party professional organizations.</p>	
                            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                            <p>Cloud computing adoption is on the rise every year, and it doesn't take long to see why. Enterprises recognize cloud computing benefits and see how they impact their production, collaboration, security and revenue. <br>
                                <br>

                                By using a cloud-based solution, an enterprise can prevent a lot of problems that plague organizations that rely on on-premises infrastructure.</p>
