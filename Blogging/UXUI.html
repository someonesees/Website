                            <p>5 practical requirements to make you a better UX/UI Designer. Not just about design tools or resources, they make you more qualified to your designer job requirements. <br>
                                <br>

                                While I was starting this article, I contemplated the board, trying to find a more appropriate entry to begin — should I make a list of UI UX designer requirements. Such as, “which books about design you should read?” or “which design blogs you must follow”. Or I can simply focus on the details instead of form a border perspective to talking about. Since there are already plenty excellent essays discussing about UI UX Designer Requirements from a big picture, I would like to suggest some practical tips and principles which may make a UI UX designer more qualified.</p>
                                <h4>Obviously, mastering an efficient prototyping tool is a must</h4>	
                                <p>Time and practice r will take until you find the faster, simpler and smarter one. Meanwhile, your good design competence and rich specialized knowledge are required and advanced during your search. <br>
                                    <br>
    
                                    A serious note for you, trying every prototyping tools before you made your decision. Just give them all a shot then you won’t miss, then stick to your favorite one and master it. So the UI UX designer requirements here is to practice more prototyping tools even though you already has one, it may surprises you beyond your imaginations.</p>
                                
                                <h4>Supposing you were a real user rather than just a UI / UX designer is a big help</h4>
                                <p>By “supposing” i mean shifting your mind into a real user. This kind of role reversal may build a shortcut to improve your design. Every UI / UX designer should stick with the principle that design with knowing its intention. Product derives from demand, this golden rule still works. If possible, trying to build a lasting and friendly connection with your user. It is very considerate for there are might plenty questions they will encounter during the application period. <br>
                                    <br>
    
                                    Moreover, your user would even appreciate it more if you have always been kind and skillful when communicate with them. And in turn, they will stick to your product and give you timely and valuable feedback. You are the winner finally. Do remember the Do’s and Don’ts of User-Centered Design. So the UI UX Designer requirements here is being nice to your user and being as one.</p>	
                                
                                <h4>Changing a little bit of your way of learning may works like a charm</h4>
                                <p>First, a question-what is the book you recently read? If your answer is a book about design or just a design magazine. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Yes, they are more about arts and philosophies rather than teh design itself. My recommendation there does not mean you should just drop your design books such as Designing Design or Interaction Design. The fact is that design requires aesthetics, not only from the visual aspect but also from the connotation side. You just need to learn more. So the UI UX Designer requirements here is going to a library and buy some books. Then sit quietly and start reading.
                                
                                </p>	
    
                                <h4>Stop hanging out only with your designer friends will spark your inspiration</h4>
                                <p>The term “confirmation bias” exists not only in psychology & cognitive science field. It actually is overwhelming in our daily life. We all tend to agree with people who agree with us. We prefer hang out with people share similar worldview. However, your view narrows as you limit your field. Meeting people with different perspectives draws a more completed and balanced picture. <br>
                                    <br>
    
                                    Openness is an endless inspiration source which serves an important trait of a great designer. For example, when you design a food app, just get together with your best foodie friend. He or she will definitely provides you valuable advice which in result, will boost you work. So the UI UX Designer requirements here is hanging out with non-designers or with anyone who holds different beliefs, challenges you and brings new perspectives.</p>
                                
                                <h4>Learning from the best will make a difference</h4>
                                <p>Human being is social animals, then just be as one. Do not against your nature to be a lone wolf, trying to do things “ in a pack ”. You must have been through this period, no matter you are a famous UI UX designer already or a new comer of this field, you must have learned from the best, and you are going to do with that. It is like climbing a mountain, you look at the peak and keep climbing, and finally you became the “ peak ” of some others. Learning from the best is a good a way helps you to absorb the wisdom and turn it into yours. So the UI UX Designer requirements here is to being modest and learning to learn. <br>
                                    <br>
    
                                    I hope you enjoyed the read and even your light benefit from my article will courage me to keep writing. We all may found ourselves feeling insecure sometimes. However, i am not going to give up easily. I am not obligated to win , but i am obligated to keep trying. This requirement is for you and me both.</p>

                                <h6>Unsurprisingly, the video games industry is one of the largest proponents of Virtual Reality. Support for the Oculus Rift headsets has already been jerry-rigged into games like Skyrim and Grand Theft Auto, but newer games like Elite: Dangerous come with headset support built right in. Many tried-and-true user interface metaphors in gaming have to be adjusted for VR (after all, who wants to have to pick items out of a menu that takes up your entire field of vision?), but the industry has been quick to adapt as the hardware for true Virtual Reality gaming has become more widely available.</h6>
                                
                            </blockquote>
                            <h5>Virtual Reality and data visualization</h5>
                            <p>Scientific and engineering data visualization has benefited for years from Virtual Reality, although recent innovation in display technology has generated interest in everything from molecular visualization to architecture to weather models.</p>
                            <h5>VR for aviation, medicine, and the military</h5>
                            <p>In aviation, medicine, and the military, Virtual Reality training is an attractive alternative to live training with expensive equipment, dangerous situations, or sensitive technology. Commercial pilots can use realistic cockpits with VR technology in holistic training programs that incorporate virtual flight and live instruction. Surgeons can train with virtual tools and patients, and transfer their virtual skills into the operating room, and studies have already begun to show that such training leads to faster doctors who make fewer mistakes. Police and soldiers are able to conduct virtual raids that avoid putting lives at risk.</p>
                            <h4>Virtual Reality and the treatment of mental illness</h4>
                            <p>Speaking of medicine, the treatment of mental illness, including post-traumatic stress disorder, stands to benefit from the application of Virtual Reality technology to ongoing therapy programs. Whether it’s allowing veterans to confront challenges in a controlled environment, or overcoming phobias in combination with behavioral therapy, VR has a potential beyond gaming, industrial and marketing applications to help people heal from, reconcile and understand real-world experiences.</p>
