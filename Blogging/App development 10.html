                            <p>For any business time is money. So as long as the development goes, the more the company will end up spending. If you have looked into different mobile app development option you will have by now realized that it is not at all an easy business. It is all about what you plan to achieve from your app development project. On one hand you want the app project to get completed as soon as possible as it will bring down the development costs. You will be able to market the app quickly and this will help you start making money out of it fast.
                            </p>
                            <p>For any business, this is the basic thing that they expect. But if you try to push the development process too hard you will end up spending more down the years. It will cost you more in all terms. However, if you are too much specific about things then chances are more that the development process will get stretched from the expected timeline and this can also badly affect your pockets. Now this is not something you want to happen too. <br>
                                <br>

                                So, it would be better that you come up with a solution that falls in between the two scenarios. <br>
                                <br>
                                
                                No doubt app development timeline may vary based on different projects, still you can try to know the time period by understanding a few things. <br>
                                <br>
                                
                                Some of such factors have been mentioned below. Once you go through them you will get an idea about how long will it take for your project to get completed.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Quality</h4>
                            <p>You need to be very sure that the timeline for app development should not affect the quality of the app. So, for the same reason it is very important that you set realistic goal. Don’t make promises which you may not end up fulfilling in the end. Doing this may affect the quality of the app. <br>
                            <br>
                            Suppose for example, you have a good business and you are planning to expand your sales by developing a mobile app. This all seems to be a good idea, Right? <br>
                            <br>

                            Your app development is said to start on Jan 1st then you should not announce your customers that they will have the app ready for downloads by March 1st.
                            
                            This can be a foolish thing to do. <br>
                            <br>

                            
                            It takes time to build a quality app. This is the ground level reality. If you will try to come up with an app in haste, quality will be compromised for sure. <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            Still, there are situations where the app development timeline can be accelerated. <br>
                            <br>

                            
                            If you are trying to come up with a minimum viable product then you will be able to shorter the development timeline. Again, if you are building a basic app which does not come with complex features you will be able to complete app development in short interval of time. <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            On the other hand, if the app is of complex nature and comes with great functionality then it will take longer time to develop it. <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            Quality will not suffer with speeding up the development when you are building MVPs and simple apps. This is for the simple reason that there is no much to be done on the app. With the increase in complexity, more work and effort will be needed and this will add up the space on the timeline.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Size matters</h4>
                        <p>We have now seen that the size of the project will have direct influence on the length of development time.

                            The average file size of an app will help you determine the time taken to develop it. The ones with larger size will have more complex features compared to the ones with smaller file size. In short a gaming app with complex features will take time to develop rather than a simple utility app like calculator.</p>	
                        <br>
                        <p>There are four factors which are said to be responsible for determining the size of the app and it also works on determining the length of development. They are: <br>
                            <br>

                            1. Scope <br>
                            2. Depth <br>
                            3. Features <br>
                            4. Purpose <br>
                            So, let’s see them in a bit detail below:</p>	
                        
                        <h5>1. Scope</h5>
                        <p>The outreach of the app is what is meant by the word scope. So, is your app for a local business or a school? Or is the app meant for multinational company which comes with large number of APIs in the Back-end? <br>
                            <br>

                            Now you can clearly understand the difference between the two business models and so the size of the app can be imagined too. The scope of the app will also take the size of the device screens as well as the development platforms that are targeted. <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            This means if you are planning to develop an app which has to be added on the Google Play Store, you will have to ensure that the app is easily accessible for all the screen sizes available for Android phones and tablets. <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            It is not difficult to take care of the screen size of the app during the development phase. But deciding on the app platform is the harder decision to make. So, whether you wish to go for Android or iOS is a different scene altogether. The size of the app will be decided on your answer. So, this is something which you should keep in mind when you are trying to know the scope of your app development project.</p>	
                        <h5>2. Depth</h5>
                        <p>The kind of user accessibility your app offers is what linked with the depth of the app. Whether the app needs to be accessed when necessary or do you want to make the app available frequently with new features? <br>
                            <br>

                            In the former case, the app will not be used frequently and user will open it only when needed and so the development time will not be long too. <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            On the contrary, if the app will be used frequently, user interaction will be constant too. So the app will have to work towards improving the user interaction. This means you can expect more time spent on development in order to deliver the best user experience before the app is launched.</p>	
                        <h5>3. Features</h5>
                        <p>Features of the app can also add up the depth. The more complex features you will have in the app, the more amount of time it will take to develop the app. <br>
                            <br>

                            If you are planning to use some common plugins in the app for some functionality then all that the developer has to do is to install them in the app which will take very less amount of time. But if you wish your app to have more number of customized features then it will take much time to work on plugin. <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            The features in the app will also be impacted by the user experience. Chances of having in-depth features increases when there are customized logins and unique user profiles in the app. Such types of app may also have complex features like real-time updates. <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            Let’s imagine an app that offers taxi service to the customers and has features which are similar to Uber. <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            Such kind of app is complex and so you will have to add in a number of features during development.</p>	
                            <br>
                            <h6> <li>You will need GPS tracking service to connect drivers with riders.</li> <br>
                                <li>The drivers as well as the user will need to have a unique profile of their own. </li> <br>
                                <li>There should be facility available in the app which can help to store payment information securely as well as process it properly.</li></h6>
                            
                            <p>Such kind of features can be called as the basic ones. So, think about situations where you will need to add in app features like this. The more and better features you would want to have in your app, you will have to anticipate that the app development will conclude towards the end of the average timeline you have set for the same.</p>
                            
                        <h5>4. Purpose</h5>
                        <p>Every app development process is a result of an idea. But something that you need to know and understand is that the idea should have a clear purpose for the app. <br>
                            <br>

                            Why would someone use the app? Who are the people getting benefited from it? How is the app going to make things easier for the user? You will not be able to come up with a clear purpose if your answer is everywhere. <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            If we take the earlier example of the taxi app, you will not have plans to make it work as an app for social media platform too. This will conflict with its original purpose. Again, you may be not planning to use the app for giving away top news or sports update. Such kind of features will just complicate the app and burden it with unnecessary features. This means you will not have an app that depicts a clear purpose. So, this clearly means that if you are not clear about the app purpose at the first place before app development starts then you will end up turning a simple app into a soup.<br>
                            <br>
                            
                            Moreover, adding all those features in your app will take years to complete the project and this will all happen while draining your pockets. So have one idea clear in your mind and stick to it.</p>	
                        
                        <h5>Plan your budget</h5>
                        <p>The more time will be spent on the development, the more amount of money you will have to spend. Now this is not always bad. Again, with the introduction of more complex features in the app, you will be bound to spend more money.<br>
                            <br>

                            So, plan your budget first before you start with development.<br>
                            <br>
                            
                            Take your time to research and try to know the amount of money required on each app development phase. This will help you to have enough beforehand the development starts. Trust me; the last thing you want is to see is your app project stopped just because you have run out of your money. <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            Remember that half-finished project is not going to do any good to your business and it is completely useless. <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            This does not mean that you need to spend too high on the project. You need to be reasonable and ensure you don’t spend on features that are not needed. Adding in unwanted features will simply complicate the things.</p>	
                        
                        <h4>Who is working on the app development project?</h4>
                        <p>For the app development timeline, the person or the company who will be working on the project is critical too. You can have a developer hired or a development company, based on your convenience. You can even have your team to build the project. It is important that they follow GO-TO-MARKET mobile app development strategy. <br>
                            <br>

                            Building your own app can save you some money, though not much. However, it can cause your development time to extend if you are not well aware of coding, app development and testing, and lastly publishing it. <br>
