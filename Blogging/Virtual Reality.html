                            <p>Virtual reality technology fabricates an absorbing experience for any user making them realise they are interacting with their digital environment in real and also creating real-life simulations. To be more facile, virtual reality creates a virtual world for the users but is fashioned in a way where the difference between real and virtual world is quite hard to tell. A computer created, artificial simulation or recreation of some real life situation is what virtual reality is. Vision and hearing of the user are simulated primarily, immersing them in a completely different world.</p>
                            <p>Virtual Reality (VR) is the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment. Virtual Reality’s most immediately-recognizable component is the head-mounted display (HMD). Human beings are visual creatures, and display technology is often the single biggest difference between immersive Virtual Reality systems and traditional user interfaces. Major players in Virtual Reality include HTC Vive, Oculus Rift and PlayStation VR (PSVR)</p>
                            <h4>What is Virtual Reality?</h4>
                            <p>Virtual Reality (VR) is the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment. Unlike traditional user interfaces, VR places the user inside an experience. Instead of viewing a screen in front of them, users are immersed and able to interact with 3D worlds. By simulating as many senses as possible, such as vision, hearing, touch, even smell, the computer is transformed into a gatekeeper to this artificial world. The only limits to near-real VR experiences are the availability of content and cheap computing power.</p>
                            <h4>Working of VR</h4>
                            <p>Virtual reality uses a range of systems like omnidirectional treadmills, headsets, and special gloves to actually trigger our senses together in order to create the illusion of reality. Unlike the earlier historical era of virtual reality, today the virtual reality is usually implemented using computer technology. Now the difficult part was to implement realism and immersiveness because our brains are evolved to provide us with a finely mediated and synchronized experience and anything out of sync would be recognized easily. Virtual reality involves both conceptual and technical parts and successful application of virtual reality with the right software, hardware, and sensory synchronicity, it would build a new concept called as a sense of presence where the object would feel like they are actually present in the real.</p>
                          <h4>VR Applications</h4>
                          <p>Like for a war zone, your home would convert into a battleground with a 3D environment where you will navigate, immerse and interact with the help of special hardware devices. To experience VR, one needs a VR headset and the VR app, that makes both the hardware and the software for it. The VR headset fits on your eyes and over your head, and visually disconnects you from the physical space you’re occupying. It lets you experience a different reality in a computer-generated environment. With VR you can virtually tour the Louvre, hike the Grand Canyon, and immerse yourself in a video game without leaving your couch. It is highly engrossing and so is being considered the next big thing in the tech industry. In the entertainment sector, from films made by Hollywood to theatrical experiences and live-streamed concerts, VR has become a place to view media that surround you. To capture these VR stories, new cameras and tools are being built and the number is ever-growing for their upload and live streaming. Soon these experiences might seem like reality and not films anymore. The gaming sector is obviously the most dominant area of VR which gives designers the freedom to take games to incredible new places and replace the usual joysticks and buttons controllers with the ability to touch and reach things. The designing has also become quite easy with VR where the designers can use virtual tools to build a real home or design car and other vehicle parts just like they were for real. Wand-like controllers and apps are already making VR an amazing playground and very soon these will be vital for all the designing work. Virtual reality is so engrossing that in the real estate sector, even from miles away, one could easily walk down the house they wish to seem like they were already there or fit in your favourite furniture to see how it would look. These would all be possible with VR. it would allow its users to walk into a virtual clothing store with infinite varieties and options to try on the spot. Now imagine climbing Mt.Everest while sitting home or visit famous destinations or even capturing your own memories in a 360-degree camera. VR can model the world in an incredibly visual way, chemistry, medicine, astronomy or physics, its simulations can offer designs, techniques, and ideas in every field.</p>
                          <p>Whatever it is too expensive, dangerous or impractical in real, virtual reality is the answer. Virtual reality allows us to take virtual risks in order to experience the real world, from trainee surgeons in the medical field to trainee fighter pilots, VR is getting mainstream. VR can be implemented in any form of media be it videos or movies but that would only be possible through VR hardware like goggles and headsets that are being manufactured by companies like OnePlus, Samsung and Oculus Rift. The Virtual reality is now not just confined to social networking and video games that are developed for a virtual environment but has a broader scope. Virtual reality uses a host of technologies to achieve its goal of providing a virtual environment with the appropriate responses in real time and this is a technically complex feat that has to account for our cognition and perception. Virtual reality and augmented reality, if worked together, could substantively change the way we see and communicate with the world and other things.</p>
                          <h4>What’s the difference Between Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality?</h4>
                          <p>Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality are two sides of the same coin. You could think of Augmented Reality as VR with one foot in the real world: Augmented Reality simulates artificial objects in the real environment; Virtual Reality creates an artificial environment to inhabit. <br>
                            <br>

                            In Augmented Reality, the computer uses sensors and algorithms to determine the position and orientation of a camera. AR technology then renders the 3D graphics as they would appear from the viewpoint of the camera, superimposing the computer-generated images over a user’s view of the real world. <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            In Virtual Reality, the computer uses similar sensors and math. However, rather than locating a real camera within a physical environment, the position of the user’s eyes are located within the simulated environment. If the user’s head turns, the graphics react accordingly. Rather than compositing virtual objects and a real scene, VR technology creates a convincing, interactive world for the user.</p>
                           
                           <h4>Virtual Reality technology</h4>
                           <p>Virtual Reality’s most immediately-recognizable component is the head-mounted display (HMD). Human beings are visual creatures, and display technology is often the single biggest difference between immersive Virtual Reality systems and traditional user interfaces. For instance, CAVE automatic virtual environments actively display virtual content onto room-sized screens. While they are fun for people in universities and big labs, consumer and industrial wearables are the wild west. <br>
                            <br>

                            With a multiplicity of emerging hardware and software options, the future of wearables is unfolding but yet unknown. Concepts such as the HTC Vive Pro Eye, Oculus Quest and Playstation VR are leading the way, but there are also players like Google, Apple, Samsung, Lenovo and others who may surprise the industry with new levels of immersion and usability. Whomever comes out ahead, the simplicity of buying a helmet-sized device that can work in a living-room, office, or factory floor has made HMDs center stage when it comes to Virtual Reality technologies.</p> 
                           <h4>Virtual Reality and the importance of audio</h4>
                           <p>Convincing Virtual Reality applications require more than just graphics. Both hearing and vision are central to a person’s sense of space. In fact, human beings react more quickly to audio cues than to visual cues. In order to create truly immersive Virtual Reality experiences, accurate environmental sounds and spatial characteristics are a must. These lend a powerful sense of presence to a virtual world. To experience the binaural audio details that go into a Virtual Reality experience, put on some headphones and tinker with this audio infographic published by The Verge. <br>
                            <br>

                            While audio-visual information is most easily replicated in Virtual Reality, active research and development efforts are still being conducted into the other senses. Tactile inputs such as omnidirectional treadmills allow users to feel as though they’re actually walking through a simulation, rather than sitting in a chair or on a couch. Haptic technologies, also known as kinesthetic or touch feedback tech, have progressed from simple spinning-weight “rumble” motors to futuristic ultrasound technology. It is now possible to hear and feel true-to-life sensations along with visual VR experiences.</p>
                            <h4>How Virtual Reality is being used today</h4>
   

                            <blockquote class="mb-30">
                                <h6>Unsurprisingly, the video games industry is one of the largest proponents of Virtual Reality. Support for the Oculus Rift headsets has already been jerry-rigged into games like Skyrim and Grand Theft Auto, but newer games like Elite: Dangerous come with headset support built right in. Many tried-and-true user interface metaphors in gaming have to be adjusted for VR (after all, who wants to have to pick items out of a menu that takes up your entire field of vision?), but the industry has been quick to adapt as the hardware for true Virtual Reality gaming has become more widely available.</h6>
                                
                            </blockquote>
                            <h5>Virtual Reality and data visualization</h5>
                            <p>Scientific and engineering data visualization has benefited for years from Virtual Reality, although recent innovation in display technology has generated interest in everything from molecular visualization to architecture to weather models.</p>
                            <h5>VR for aviation, medicine, and the military</h5>
                            <p>In aviation, medicine, and the military, Virtual Reality training is an attractive alternative to live training with expensive equipment, dangerous situations, or sensitive technology. Commercial pilots can use realistic cockpits with VR technology in holistic training programs that incorporate virtual flight and live instruction. Surgeons can train with virtual tools and patients, and transfer their virtual skills into the operating room, and studies have already begun to show that such training leads to faster doctors who make fewer mistakes. Police and soldiers are able to conduct virtual raids that avoid putting lives at risk.</p>
                            <h4>Virtual Reality and the treatment of mental illness</h4>
                            <p>Speaking of medicine, the treatment of mental illness, including post-traumatic stress disorder, stands to benefit from the application of Virtual Reality technology to ongoing therapy programs. Whether it’s allowing veterans to confront challenges in a controlled environment, or overcoming phobias in combination with behavioral therapy, VR has a potential beyond gaming, industrial and marketing applications to help people heal from, reconcile and understand real-world experiences.</p>
