                            <h6>"Edge computing optimizes internet devices and web applications by bringing computing closer to the source of the data. This minimizes the need for long distance communications between client and server, which reduces latency and bandwidth usage."</h6>

                            <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) should comprise of around 50 million objects worldwide – the Internet of Things being a network of electronic systems from personal scales to industrial production facilities. All these devices generate continuous data output that must be stored and evaluated in real time for critical applications: a task that established cloud solutions will hardly be able to cope with. <br>
                                <br>

                                The slowdown in broadband expansion and delays in data transmission between central cloud servers and end devices at the edge of the network are the main obstacles to growth. Edge computing avoids both problems and therefore indicates a paradigm shift in the age of cloud computing.</p>
                            
                        <p>Edge computing is transforming the way data is being handled, processed, and delivered from millions of devices around the world. The explosive growth of internet-connected devices – the IoT – along with new applications that require real-time computing power, continues to drive edge-computing systems. <br>
                            <br>

                            Faster networking technologies, such as 5G wireless, are allowing for edge computing systems to accelerate the creation or support of real-time applications, such as video processing and analytics, self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and robotics, to name a few.</p>	
                        
                        
                        <h4>What is edge computing?</h4>
                        <p>Gartner defines edge computing as “a part of a distributed computing topology in which information processing is located close to the edge – where things and people produce or consume that information.” <br>
                            <br>

                            At its basic level, edge computing brings computation and data storage closer to the devices where it’s being gathered, rather than relying on a central location that can be thousands of miles away. This is done so that data, especially real-time data, does not suffer latency issues that can affect an application’s performance. In addition, companies can save money by having the processing done locally, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed in a centralized or cloud-based location. <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            Edge computing was developed due to the exponential growth of IoT devices, which connect to the internet for either receiving information from the cloud or delivering data back to the cloud. And many IoT devices generate enormous amounts of data during the course of their operations.</p>	
                            <div class="featured">
                                <figure>
                                    <img src="img/blog-img/edge1.png" style="height: 80%; width: 70%;">
                                    
                                </figure>
                            </div>
                        
                        <p>Think about devices that monitor manufacturing equipment on a factory floor, or an internet-connected video camera that sends live footage from a remote office. While a single device producing data can transmit it across a network quite easily, problems arise when the number of devices transmitting data at the same time grows. Instead of one video camera transmitting live footage, multiply that by hundreds or thousands of devices. Not only will quality suffer due to latency, but the costs in bandwidth can be tremendous. <br>
                            <br>

                            Edge-computing hardware and services help solve this problem by being a local source of processing and storage for many of these systems. An edge gateway, for example, can process data from an edge device, and then send only the relevant data back through the cloud, reducing bandwidth needs. Or it can send data back to the edge device in the case of real-time application needs. <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            These edge devices can include many different things, such as an IoT sensor, an employee’s notebook computer, their latest smartphone, the security camera or even the internet-connected microwave oven in the office break room. Edge gateways themselves are considered edge devices within an edge-computing infrastructure.</p>	
                        
                        
                        <h4>Edge computing vs. fog computing</h4>
                        <p>The approach of adding local calculation instances to the cloud is not new. As early as 2014, the US technology group Cisco established the marketing term “fog computing”: a concept that relies on the decentralized preprocessing of data in “fog nodes”. Fog nodes are local mini data centers that are located in front of the cloud and therefore represent an intermediate level in the network (referred to as a fog layer). Data generated to IoT environments no longer reaches the cloud directly, but is first merged into fog nodes, evaluated and selected for further processing steps. <br>
                            <br>

                            Today, edge computing is seen as part of fog computing, where IT resources like computing power and storage capacity move even closer to IoT terminals at the edge of the network. While data processing in fog computing architectures initially takes place on the fog layer, in edge computing concepts it takes place in powerful IoT routers or even directly on the device or sensor. A combination of both concepts is also conceivable. The following graphic shows an architecture like this with cloud, fog and edge layers.</p>	
                        
                            <div class="featured">
                                <figure>
                                    <img src="img/blog-img/edge2.png" >
                                    
                                </figure>
                            </div>
                        
                        <h4>Why choose edge computing?</h4>
                        <p>A drilling rig produces around 500 gigabytes of data per week; the turbine of a modern commercial aircraft around 10 terabytes in 30 minutes. Data volumes of this size can neither be loaded into the cloud nor evaluated in real time through mobile networks. In addition, the use of third-party networks is associated with high costs. It must therefore be decided locally how much and which generated information should be transmitted and stored to central systems and which data can be evaluated locally. This is where edge computing comes in. <br>
                            <br>

                            Currently, central data centers carry the majority of the data load generated by the internet. Today, however, data sources are often mobile and too far away from the central mainframe to ensure an acceptable response time (latency). This is particularly problematic for time-critical applications like machine learning and predictive maintenance, with intelligent production facilities and self-regulating supply networks.</p>	
                        
                        <p>Private internet use – streaming high resolution videos to mobile devices, VR and augmented reality – is already pushing traditional cloud concepts and the bandwidth of available networks to their limits. And the introduction of the new 5G mobile radio standard with a transmission speed of up to 10 GB/s will not provide a release, but increase it, according to experts. Edge computing does not provide a solution to this problem either. Rather, the concept raises the question of whether all data must actually be processed in the cloud in IoT environments.</p>
                        <p>Edge computing is not seen as a replacement, but as a supplement to the cloud, which provides the following functions:</p>
                        <h6>1. Data collection and aggregation:</h6><p>While data sources in traditional cloud architectures transfer all data to a core data center in the cloud for central analysis, edge computing relies on data collection close to the source. For this purpose, micro-controllers are used directly in the device or else in gateways – i.e. “intelligent routers”. These combine data from different devices and enable the preprocessing and selection of a dataset. Uploading into the cloud only takes place if information cannot be evaluated locally, detailed analyses are required or data is to be archived.</p>
                        
                        <h6>2. Local data storage:</h6><p>Edge computing is particularly useful when broadband data needs to be provided locally. For large numbers of data, real-time transmission from the core data center in the cloud is usually impossible. This problem can be circumvented by storing corresponding data decentrally at the edge of the network. In a scenario like this, edge gateways act as replica servers in a content delivery network.</p>

                        <h6>3. AI supported monitoring:</h6><p>The decentralized processing units of an edge computing environment receive data, evaluate it and subsequently enable continuous monitoring of the connected devices. Combined with machine learning algorithms, status monitoring in real time is possible – for example to control and optimize processes in intelligent factories.</p>

                        <h6>4. M2M communication: </h6><p>M2M stands for “machine to machine”, a buzzword for the automated exchange of information between end devices through any communication standards. In IoT environments like an intelligent factory, M2M communication could be used for remote monitoring of machines and plants. Within the framework of process control, both communication between the end devices and communication with a central control center, which functions as a monitoring authority (AI supported monitoring), is possible.</p>


                        <h4>Why does edge computing matter?</h4>
                        <p>For many companies, the cost savings alone can be a driver towards deploying an edge-computing architecture. Companies that embraced the cloud for many of their applications may have discovered that the costs in bandwidth were higher than they expected. <br>
                            <br>

                            Increasingly, though, the biggest benefit of edge computing is the ability to process and store data faster, enabling for more efficient real-time applications that are critical to companies. Before edge computing, a smartphone scanning a person’s face for facial recognition would need to run the facial recognition algorithm through a cloud-based service, which would take a lot of time to process. With an edge computing model, the algorithm could run locally on an edge server or gateway, or even on the smartphone itself, given the increasing power of smartphones. Applications such as virtual and augmented reality, self-driving cars, smart cities and even building-automation systems require fast processing and response. <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            “Edge computing has evolved significantly from the days of isolated IT at ROBO [Remote Office Branch Office] locations,” says Kuba Stolarski, a research director at IDC, in the “Worldwide Edge Infrastructure (Compute and Storage) Forecast, 2019-2023” report. “With enhanced interconnectivity enabling improved edge access to more core applications, and with new IoT and industry-specific business use cases, edge infrastructure is poised to be one of the main growth engines in the server and storage market for the next decade and beyond.” <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            Companies such as NVIDIA have recognized the need for more processing at the edge, which is why we’re seeing new system modules that include artificial intelligence functionality built into them. The company’s latest Jetson Xavier NX module, for example, is smaller than a credit-card, and can be built into smaller devices such as drones, robots and medical devices. AI algorithms require large amounts of processing power, which is why most of them run via cloud services. The growth of AI chipsets that can handle processing at the edge will allow for better real-time responses within applications that need instant computing.</p>
                            
                        
                        <h4>Applications for edge computing architectures</h4>
                        <p>Uses for edge computing usually originate from the IoT environment and, like the concept of a decentralized cloud architecture, still exist only in future projects. An important growth driver for edge computing technology is the increasing demand for real-time capable communication systems. Decentralized data processing is classified as a key technology for the following projects:</p>
                        <h6>Car-to-Car communication <br>
                            Smart Grid <br>
                            Smart Factory</h6>	
                        
                        <p>In the future, a Connected Car – networked car – will become more than just a vehicle with an Internet connection. The future of mobility promises cloud-based early warning systems based on car-to-car communication and even completely autonomous means of transport. This requires an infrastructure that makes it possible to exchange data in real time between the vehicles and communication points on the track. <br>
                            <br>

                            The electricity grid of the future will also be adaptive, and, thanks to decentralized energy management systems, will adapt to fluctuations in output. Smart grids are becoming a key technology in the context of the energy revolution. Switching to renewable energies poses new challenges for electricity grids. Instead of a few large central generators, numerous smaller and decentralized power generators have to be connected to storage facilities and end consumers. Thanks to solar panels, some of the latter even become electricity generators themselves. Intelligent networks therefore not only transport electricity, but they also supply data for its generation, storage and consumption. This enables everyone involved to react to changes in real time. The aim is to keep power grids stable despite increasing complexity and to make them more efficient through intelligent load control. New cloud concepts like Edge and Fog computing are needed to capture, store and process the resulting data masses in the shortest possible time. <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            A smart factory is a self-organizing production facility and logistics system that ideally no longer requires human intervention. An intelligent factory is practically a system of networked devices, machines and sensors that communicate with each other through the Internet of Things to carry out manufacturing processes. The smart factory communication system even includes the finished product and can therefore automatically react to supply and demand. AI systems and machine learning can be used to automate maintenance processes and production optimization. This requires an IT infrastructure that can evaluate large amounts of data and react to unforeseen events without delay. Traditional cloud systems failed because of the latency problem. Fog and edge computing architectures solve this problem through distributed data processing.</p>	
                        
                        <h4>Privacy and security</h4>
                        <p>However, as is the case with many new technologies, solving one problem can create others. From a security standpoint, data at the edge can be troublesome, especially when it’s being handled by different devices that might not be as secure as a centralized or cloud-based system. As the number of IoT devices grow, it’s imperative that IT understand the potential security issues around these devices, and to make sure those systems can be secured. This includes making sure that data is encrypted, and that the correct access-control methods and even VPN tunneling is utilized. <br>
                            <br>

                            Furthermore, differing device requirements for processing power, electricity and network connectivity can have an impact on the reliability of an edge device. This makes redundancy and failover management crucial for devices that process data at the edge to ensure that the data is delivered and processed correctly when a single node goes down.</p>	
                        
                        <h4>Edge computing: Advantages and disadvantages</h4>
                        <p>The following table compares the advantages and disadvantages of edge computing architecture compared to classic cloud environments.</p>
