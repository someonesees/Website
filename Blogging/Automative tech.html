                            <p>As cars become smarter and more automated, a lot of innovative technology will be needed to make them even more useful to drivers. Manufacturing cars of the future – be they autonomous, connected, electric, or a mix of all three – will be fueled by cutting-edge technology.</p>
                            <p>Success in automotive manufacturing will require modernizing business processes, adopting new business models as well as the ability to gather, manage, analyze and make use of the large amounts of data being generated by drivers and the cars themselves. Underlying these success factors are five key technologies that are driving the automotive industry into the future:</p>
								<h4>1. Internet of Things (IoT)</h4>
								<p>There is a tremendous amount of data that can now be captured, digested, analyzed and acted upon. Using IoT and sensor technology, data can be gathered on things like steering, braking and how effectively a car navigates the road then inserted into the testing cycle to continuously improve autonomous driving capabilities. Beyond autonomous driving development, IoT data is providing fuel for many other business opportunities such as predictive maintenance, connected car functionality, and data monetization</p>
								<h4>2. Cloud/hybrid computing models</h4>
								<p>With the increased demand for computing and data in the auto industry, there is a tremendous amount of collaborative innovation going on in terms of computing capacity, data ingestion, data pipelines, and AI and analytics-based algorithms. Auto companies have new computing needs that only cloud and hybrid computing models can address by providing access to increased capacity on demand when companies have compute-intensive, storage-intensive workloads, or both. Cloud providers are investing significant R&D resources in these areas and car companies are collaborating with these providers to leverage innovation to accelerate their path to the right outcomes.</p>
								<h4>3. In-car apps</h4>
								<p>The latest car models are brimming with software – some having more lines of code than a modern-day jet fighter. Data gathered through IoT and other means can be leveraged to provide drivers with value-added services via in-car apps. For example, real-time driving data can be used to provide information for navigation apps that alert drivers to road conditions, traffic hazards and items of interest nearby. Automakers need to manage in-car software assets in a coherent manner, which includes testing, deploying the software in the right way, and tracking it so there’s a record of what’s deployed if something breaks.</p>
								<h4>4. AI and analytics</h4>
								<p>A recurring theme in the future of automotive manufacturing is harnessing the huge amount of data being generated. Companies will need to deploy the right industry-based analytics and AI platforms to put all that data to good use. For cars to become fully automated there is a strong need to employ AI, analytics, data management and digital workflows to speed up testing and simulation, and the product development life cycle. Analytics can be applied in many ways, from assessing production efficiency for reducing waste and costs to analyzing customer sentiment to predict failures and anticipate recalls.</p>
								<h4>5. Digital factory</h4>
								<p>A digital factory can be integral for producing cars in a fast, standardized and error-free manner across multiple locations throughout the globe. It uses technologies such as modeling, automation and digitization to provide the foundation for flexible and stable manufacturing processes. In addition to standardizing the use of automation and robotics in manufacturing, the use of a digital factory can produce business benefits in areas such as supply chain logistics, quality control and maintenance.</p>
								<h4>6. Self-Parking Systems</h4>
								<p>Many modern cars come with impressive self-parking systems. The great part about these systems is that they are available on some mid-level cars as well, not just high-dollar models. <br>
									<br>

									Basically, these systems do exactly what the name suggests—they allow the car to park by itself. It isn’t completely autonomous, because in most cases the system still requires the driver to shift the car into and out of reverse, but self-parking systems handle the steering wheel and sometimes the throttle as well. <br>
									<br>
									
									The systems use a wide array of sensors to spot if there’s enough space between other cars, and if there is, automatically figure out the moves required for the car to fit in that space.</p>
								<h4>7. Self-Driving Systems</h4>
								<p>A self-driving system is nothing but the big brother of a self-parking system, but it takes the game to a whole new level by allowing the car to perform much more complex maneuvers. Although these systems are not advanced enough to allow cars to go completely autonomous, they are smart enough to allow a car to stick to a speed, change lanes, and perform various other maneuvers. <br>
									<br>

									Google is putting a lot of effort into developing a self-driving car, and so far its results are quite impressive, with their autonomous cars now being used in road testing. The company has admitted, however, that as of May 2015, its fleet of self-driving cars has been involved in 11 minor incidents over the course of more than 1 million miles of testing. Work remains to be done to make this a fully viable technology.</p>	
								<h4>8. Fuel Cells</h4>
								<p>Classic internal combustion engines may have their days numbered. OK, maybe not literally, but it’s just a matter of time until electric engines take over. There are now many models of hybrids from a multitude of manufacturers, and a growing number of cars that are full-electric, such as the Tesla, Nissan Leaf, and others, but these are still limited by one element: the limited range of electrical power. <br>
									<br>

									Most of these cars rely on batteries for their electric engines, but these are likely to be replaced by fuel cells in the not-so-distant future. A battery can only store electricity, but a fuel cell will be able to generate it, thus removing the need for the cars to be recharged. The most common fuel-cell systems that are in the works (among the manufacturers leading the race toward fuel-cell technology are Honda, Toyota, and Hyundai) involve using oxygen and compressed hydrogen to create electricity, but manufacturers are experimenting with other elements as well.</p>
								
								<p>This just scrapes the surface of the many innovative technologies that will be used to produce autonomous vehicles, connected cars and smart factories. Automotive manufacturing has become so dependent on advanced technology, that only those companies that can successfully integrate and apply emerging technologies in a quick and efficient manner will find success. Success will be dependent upon focusing on the right platforms, managing data, industrializing AI, as well as meeting the need for standardization and agility.</p>
