                            <h6>Robots and bots are being developed to populate our homes, workplaces and social spaces, as well as the online spaces we frequent. How do people communicate with robots and bots? What does the future hold for human-robot communication and collaboration.</h6>
								<p>Robots are sent into space and to war, but increasingly people find themselves interacting with robots (and bots, their software cousins) in everyday life in homes, online, in workplaces and social spaces. In the form of self-driving vehicles, robots also seem likely to join people on the roads.</p>
								<p>This MOOC is mainly concerned with the robots and bots that you might encounter now, and may increasingly encounter as part of your everyday home, work and social lives in the near future.</p>

                                <h4>What is a robot?</h4>
							<h6>In the beginning…</h6>
							<p>The word ‘robota’ in Czech (to become ‘robot’ in English), was first used in 1920 in Karel Capek’s play R. U. R. (Rossum’s Universal Robots), although Karel explained that it was his brother Joseph who actually came up with the term. 

								The robots in R. U. R. are not metal machines, as is the case for more recent robots in fiction and most in real life. Rossum’s robots are described as ‘artificial people’ made from organic components. Their internal structure is simpler than a human’s, but their external appearance closely resembles the human factory workers they replace. </p>
							<h4>Definitions that move beyond humanlike form</h4>
							<div class="featured">
								<figure>
									<img src="img/blog-img/robot1.png">
									
								</figure>
							</div>
							<p>In spite of the link between robots and human form, the definition of what a robot is has become much broader than that. George Bekey, author of Autonomous Robots: From Biological Inspiration to Implementation and Control (2005), defines a robot as: </p>
							<h6>"A machine that senses, thinks and acts."</h6>
							<p>One way to narrow down the definition is provided by Alan Winfield, in Robotics: A Very Short Introduction (2012), who suggests that a robot is a device: <br>
								<br>

								‘that can sense its environment and purposefully act on or in that environment’;  <br>
								‘an embodied artificial intelligence’; or <br>
								‘a machine that can autonomously carry out useful work’.</p>
							<h4>What is a bot?</h4>
							<div class="featured">
								<figure>
									<img src="img/blog-img/robot2.png">
									
								</figure>
							</div>
							<p>The words ‘robot’ and ‘bot’ are often used interchangeably, as seen in the final reading of the previous section; however, the term ‘bot’ is also often used to refer to ‘software robots’. These are pieces of computer code that exist and communicate in digital spaces. For the purposes of this MOOC, we’re going to separate robots and bots in this way, describing robots as physical machines and bots as pieces of software. <br>
								<br>

								Bots, sometimes called chatbots or socialbots, now most often interact with humans and other bots through online social platforms and websites, but they can also operate as standalone programs (and that was how they originally came to exist). <br>
								<br>
								
								As is the case for robots, many bots are programmed to appear as humanlike as possible through their communication and behaviour. In fact, some are designed to pass as human, so that people encountering them think they are interacting, for example, with a customer services person. Others are created to be recognisably non-human, while nonetheless interacting in interesting, useful or entertaining ways, whether in speech or writing, or even through sharing other content such as images or GIFs.</p>	
							
							<h4>Human-bot interactions</h4>
							<div class="featured">
								<figure>
									<img src="img/blog-img/robot3.png">
									
								</figure>
							</div>

							<p>the term ‘bot’, while sometimes just used as a shorthand for ‘robot’, is more often linked with robots that exist as software code. These bots do not have specialised physical bodies, although they will be encountered via a computer or smart device and are therefore embodied in a generic sense.  <br>
								<br>

								Bots are sometimes located on a particular device, but are now most often located within digital networks. As a result, we typically encounter bots on websites or social network sites, although you can also think of some automated telephone answering systems as bots, too. <br>
								<br>
								
								One of the earliest bots designed to interact with people was ELIZA, created in the mid-1960s by Joseph Weizenbaum. ELIZA’s text-based conversations with humans were framed by scripts, setting ELIZA up in various roles, most famously as a psychotherapist. <br>
								<br>
								
								New bots are being developed all the time, some of them competing for the annual Loebner Prize in a competition based on the Turing Test, proposed by Alan Turing in 1950. Each year, a set of human judges hold text-based conversations with pairs of ‘entities’ (one being human and the other a bot). The judge is asked to decide which is the bot and which is the human, providing a ranking score for the bot (assuming it doesn’t pass as human, something that has not yet occurred). Although the prize is not well-regarded by many scholars and experts in the field, it nonetheless captures the public imagination year on year.</p>	
							
							<h4>Socialbots, humanness and being social</h4>
							<p>There is a great deal of pressure to develop bots that can pass as human. In fact, that goal was built in to how early creators defined their ‘socialbots’ as software that controls a social network site account in such a way that other account holders assume it is human (Boshmaf et al., 2011, p. 93). Thus, from this perspective, to be social, a bot must be humanlike, although this assumption overlooks the breadth of social behaviour played out when humans interact with animals such as their pets, as well as behaviours observed between animals both within and across species.</p>	
						
							<div class="featured">
								<figure>
									<img src="img/blog-img/robot4.png">
									
								</figure>
							</div>
							<p>On social network sites, the use of avatars and profile images, structured profiles and communication that is mainly restricted to text may make it easier for socialbots to pass as human, but this is more difficult to achieve for systems with vocal interfaces. Many people are now familiar with the distinctly ‘not quite human’ conversational traits of Siri and Alexa, assistants from Apple and Amazon respectively. <br>
								<br>

								In some ways, making socialbots that can pass as human in conversation makes sense because it would seem to make them easy for humans to communicate with, and therefore more flexible in the roles they might take up, for example on customer service sites and booking systems. This is likely what led Google to create a new level of digital vocal assistant in the form of Duplex. <br>
								<br>
								
								The Google Duplex assistant, and the demonstration of that technology in 2018, is a good example of where making a socialbot as humanlike as possible is beginning to take us.</p>
							
							<p>As Google themselves explain, Duplex:</p>
							<h6>"is directed towards completing specific tasks, such as scheduling certain types of appointments. For such tasks, the system makes the conversational experience as natural as possible, allowing people to speak normally, like they would to another person, without having to adapt to a machine."</h6>
						<h4>Humanlike socialbots and accessibility</h4>
						<p>Google argues that exchanges with Duplex are:</p>
						<h6>"built to sound natural, to make the conversation experience comfortable."</h6>
						<p>The development of systems like Google Duplex emphasises the goal of idealised, ‘normal’ human communication in a way that doesn’t acknowledge people’s diverse voices across a multitude of languages and accents, or the various communication difficulties, which may mean a person speaks differently, or does not speak at all, in order to communicate with others. <br>
							<br>

							Text and voice interfaces pose problems for many people and are not accessible to everyone (although voice-to-text and text-to-voice functionality were originally designed to make information and applications more accessible to people with disabilities that affect their hearing and/or sight). People who have difficulty vocalising in the ‘ideal’ way most easily interpreted by a system find voice interfaces very difficult to use, and for people who are nonverbal another option is required to make the system usable at all, so it’s good to know that some developers are considering these issues.</p>

                        <h6> Humans are limited in the attention, kindness and compassion that they can expend to others, but AI based compassionate robots can channel virtually unlimited resources into building compassionate relationships in the society.
                            
                            </h6>

                    <h4>Humanness versus ‘botness’</h4>

								<div class="featured">
								<figure>
									<img src="img/blog-img/robot5.png">
									
								</figure>
							</div>	
						<p>The goal of making social bots humanlike is often assumed to be linked with giving them a clear gender. For a bot communicating in text, this might be through an assigned pronoun, name, word choices and the answers it gives to direct questions, with all of these and, of course, the voice itself, applying for a digital voice assistant. Not everyone agrees, with Jacqueline Feldman arguing not only that ‘personality need not be human’, but also that technologies need not ‘conform to the gender binary of human societies’ for people ‘to like them’ (2016). <br>
							<br>

							In many cases, the choice of gender for a socialbot will be based on the tasks it is designed to carry out…</p>	
						
						<h4>Socialbots with bodies</h4>
						<p>It’s worth noting that many of the socialbot examples we’ve read about in this module do have ‘bodies’, albeit in a rather generic sense. Siri is encountered through iPhones, iPads and Apple computers, whereas Alexa is embodied in Amazon Echo devices (and increasingly also other manufacturer’s smart devices). Google Assistant, and soon Duplex, operates from within Android phones and tablets as well as Google Home devices.</p>	
					
						<h4>Living with robots</h4>
						<div class="featured">
							<figure>
								<img src="img/blog-img/robot6.png">
								
							</figure>
						</div>	
						<p>Interactions between humans and robots are beginning to occur more often in people’s homes, where robots are increasingly used for practical and emotional support. A report released in October 2018 by the International Federation of Robotics (IFR) notes that ‘the market for personal service robots, which assist or entertain humans in their everyday lives, is progressing rapidly’. These machines include a wide variety of devices, from autonomous vacuum cleaners to more complex robots designed to address physical and social needs. </p>
						<h6>"Robotics in personal and domestic applications has experienced strong global growth. Floor cleaning robots, robo-mowers and robots for edutainment (the latter increasingly referred to as social robots), have increasingly become part of our lives. Future product visions point to domestic robots of higher sophistication, capability and value, such as assistive robots for supporting the elderly, for helping out with household chores and for entertainment."</h6>

						<h4>Assistive robots</h4>
						<div class="featured">
							<figure>
								<img src="img/blog-img/robot7.png">
								
							</figure>
						</div>	
						<p>It is important to recognise that they could actually be categorised as assistive robots. For non-disabled people, these robots are convenient tools that take over an often hated task, leaving more time for leisure, but for people with disabilities that make cleaning difficult (or impossible) to do themselves, these robots offer a way to take personal control over their private living spaces. <br>
							<br>

							The development of assistive robots raises questions about whether robots should be used as replacements for human carers, something that might reduce access to meaningful face-to-face human conversation and physical touch. However, designers clearly hope such robots can increase people’s cognitive and physical self-reliance, allowing them to continue living in their own homes for longer. <br>
							<br>

Larger, more complex and expensive assistance, or care, robots are also being developed. These robots can move around physical spaces on their own, unlike EllieQ. Examples include Carebot and the Care-o-bot. These large robots are still predominantly being trialled for use in people’s homes, and it’s difficult to tell how soon, or whether they will ever, be commercially viable. The Carebot is designed to offer non-physical assistance (in a similar way to EllieQ), but is able to monitor where someone is in the home and detect if they have fallen, in which case it can call for help. The robotic arm or arms on the Care-o-bot suggests this robot might also help people with physical tasks around the home in the future. <br>
<br>

Maybe the most important question to ask relates to the high level of monitoring and recording of information all assistive and care robots carry out, and who has access to that information. The robots are programmed to use information collected to suggest when people should take medication, fluids, food or exercise, often based on guidelines set by human carers. In most cases, information is therefore being continually reported to professional human carers and possibly also family members. However, this might impact upon the privacy and rights of the person living with the robot, issues causing particular concern for people with disabilities, disability-rights activists and ethics researchers.</p> 

<p>More specialised assistive devices, such as semi-autonomous wheelchairs, for example the SafePath Wheelchair, and robotic manipulators that attach to wheelchairs or fixed furniture, such as the iARM or the JACO robotic arm, are also available. Communication between people and these devices is often enabled through a range of interfaces that may include voice, but also physical controllers, such as joysticks, keypads, touch screens, buttons, foot switchs, sip-and-puff devices etc. <br>
	<br>

	While it’s easy to assume that communicating with these robots involves direct commands to trigger specific robot actions, the full capability of this type of assistive device may only be fully realised through a more flexible relation, within which a robot takes partial responsibility for completing tasks, such a reaching for an object and picking it up, in a collaborative interaction with the person.</p>


<h4>Will a robot take your job?</h4>
<p>The vision of robots at work has often positioned them in factories, manufacturing lines and maybe also warehouses. Increasingly though, people are realising that other jobs could be carried out by robots and/or digital autonomous technologies, such as chatbots, but also more generally computer systems.</p>
