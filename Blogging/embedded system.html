                            <p>An embedded system combines mechanical, electrical, and chemical components along with a computer, hidden inside, to perform a single dedicated purpose. There are more computers on this planet than there are people, and most of these computers are single-chip microcontrollers that are the brains of an embedded system. Embedded systems are a ubiquitous component of our everyday lives. We interact with hundreds of tiny computers every day that are embedded into our houses, our cars, our bridges, our toys, and our work. As our world has become more complex, so have the capabilities of the microcontrollers embedded into our devices. Therefore the world needs a trained workforce to develop and manage products based on embedded microcontrollers.</p>

                            <p>Embedded systems are a ubiquitous component of our everyday lives. We interact with hundreds of tiny computers every day that are embedded into our houses, our cars, our toys, and our work. As our world has become more complex, so have the capabilities of the microcontrollers embedded into our devices. The ARM® Cortex™-M family represents a new class of microcontrollers much more powerful than the devices available ten years ago. The purpose of this class is to present the design methodology to train young engineers to understand the basic building blocks that comprise devices like a cell phone, an MP3 player, a pacemaker, antilock brakes, and an engine controller.</p>
								<p>An embedded system is a system that performs a specific task and has a computer embedded inside. A system is comprised of components and interfaces connected together for a common purpose. This class is an introduction to embedded systems. Specific topics include microcontrollers, fixed-point numbers, the design of software in C, elementary data structures, programming input/output including interrupts, analog to digital conversion, digital to analog conversion.</p>

								<h4>Binary number systems</h4>
								<p>To solve problems using a computer we need to understand numbers and what they mean. Each digit in a decimal number has a place and a value. The place is a power of 10 and the value is selected from the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. A decimal number is simply a combination of its digits multiplied by powers of 10. For example <br>
									<br>

									1984 = 1•103 + 9•102 + 8•101 + 4•100 <br>
									<br>
	
	 
	
	Fractional values can be represented by using the negative powers of 10. For example, <br>
	<br>
	
									273.15 = 2•102 + 7•101 + 3•100 + 1•10-1 + 5•10-2 <br>
									<br>
	
	 
	
	In a similar manner, each digit in a binary number has a place and a value. In binary numbers, the place is a power of 2, and the value is selected from the set {0, 1}. A binary number is simply a combination of its digits multiplied by powers of 2. To eliminate confusion between decimal numbers and binary numbers, we will put a subscript 2 after the number to mean binary. Because of the way the microcontroller operates, most of the binary numbers in this class will have 8, 16, or 32 bits. An 8-bit number is called a byte, and a 16-bit number is called a halfword. For example, the 8-bit binary number for 106 is <br>
	<br>
	
				011010102 = 0•27 + 1•26 + 1•25 + 0•24 + 1•23 + 0•22 + 1•21 + 0•20 = 64+32+8+2 = 106</p>
			
		<h4>Embedded Systems</h4>
        <p>To better understand the expression embedded microcomputer system, consider each word separately. In this context, the word “embedded” means hidden inside so one can’t see it. The term “micro” means small, and a “computer” contains a processor, memory, and a means to exchange data with the external world. The word “system” means multiple components interfaced together for a common purpose. Systems have structure, behavior, and interconnectivity operating in a framework bound by rules and regulations. In an embedded system, we use ROM for storing the software and fixed constant data and RAM for storing temporary information. Many microcomputers employed in embedded systems use Flash EEPROM, which is an electrically-erasable programmable ROM, because the information can easily be erased and reprogrammed.
             The functionality of a digital watch is defined by the software programmed into its ROM. When you remove the batteries from a watch and insert new batteries, it still behaves like a watch because the ROM is nonvolatile storage. As shown in Figure 2.6, the term embedded microcomputer system refers to a device that contains one or more microcomputers inside. Microcontrollers, which are microcomputers incorporating the processor, RAM, ROM and I/O ports into a single package, are often employed in an embedded system because of their low cost, small size, and low power requirements. Microcontrollers like the Texas Instruments TM4C are available with a large number and wide variety of I/O devices, such as parallel ports, serial ports, timers, digital to analog converters (DAC), and analog to digital converters (ADC). The I/O devices are a
              crucial part of an embedded system, because they provide necessary functionality. The software together with the I/O ports and associated interface circuits give an embedded computer system its distinctive characteristics. The microcontrollers often must communicate with each other. How the system interacts with humans is often called the human-computer interface (HCI) or man-machine interface (MMI).</p>

            </div> 
            <p> a microcomputer is a small computer. One typically restricts the term embedded to refer to systems that do not look and behave like a typical computer. Most embedded systems do not have a keyboard, a graphics display, or secondary storage (disk). There are two ways to develop embedded systems. The first technique uses a microcontroller, like the ARM Cortex M-series. In general, there is no operating system, so the entire software system is developed. These devices are suitable for low-cost, low-performance systems. The book Embedded Systems: Real-Time Operating Systems for ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers describes how to design a real-time operating system for the Cortex M family of microcontrollers. On the other hand, one can develop a high-performance embedded system around a more powerful microcontroller such as the ARM Cortex A-series. These systems typically employ an operating system and are first designed on a development platform, and then the software and hardware are migrated to a stand-alone embedded platform.</p>
						<h4>What is a microcomputer? </h4>
						<p>The external devices attached to the microcontroller allow the system to interact with its environment. An interface is defined as the hardware and software that combine to allow the computer to communicate with the external hardware. We must also learn how to interface a wide range of inputs and outputs that can exist in either digital or analog form. In this class we provide an introduction to microcomputer programming, hardware interfacing, and the design of embedded systems. The book Embedded Systems: Real-Time Interfacing to ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers on the details of hardware interfacing and system design. The book Embedded Systems: Real-Time Operating Systems for ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers describes real-time operating systems and applies embedded system design to real-time data acquisition, digital signal processing, high-speed networks, and digital control systems. In general, we can classify I/O interfaces into parallel, serial, analog or time. Because of low cost, low power, and high performance, there has been and will continue to be an advantage of using time-encoded inputs and outputs. <br>
							<br>

							A device driver is a set of software functions that facilitate the use of an I/O port. One of the simplest I/O ports on the Stellaris® microcontrollers is a parallel port or General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO). One such parallel port is Port A. The software will refer to this port using the name GPIO_PORTA_DATA_R. Ports are a collection of pins, usually 8, which can be used for either input or output. If Port A is an input port, then when the software reads from GPIO_PORTA_DATA_R, it gets eight bits (each bit is 1 or 0), representing the digital levels (high or low) that exist at the time of the read. If Port A is an output port, then when the software writes to GPIO_PORTA_DATA_R, it sets the outputs on the eight pins high (1) or low (0), depending on the data value the software has written. <br>
							<br>
							
							The other general concept involved in most embedded systems is they run in real time. In a real-time computer system, we can put an upper bound on the time required to perform the input-calculation-output sequence. A real-time system can guarantee a worst case upper bound on the response time between when the new input information becomes available and when that information is processed. This response time is called interface latency. Another real-time requirement that exists in many embedded systems is the execution of periodic tasks. A periodic task is one that must be performed at equal-time intervals. A real-time system can put a small and bounded limit on the time error between when a task should be run and when it is actually run. Because of the real-time nature of these systems, microcontrollers have a rich set of features to handle many aspects of time.</p>		
					
					<p>The embedded computer systems will contain a Texas Instruments TM4C123 microcontroller, which will be programmed to perform a specific dedicated application. Software for embedded systems typically solves only a limited range of problems. The microcomputer is embedded or hidden inside the device. In an embedded system, the software is usually programmed into ROM and therefore fixed. Even so, software maintenance (e.g., verification of proper operation, updates, fixing bugs, adding features, extending to new applications, end user configurations) is still extremely important. In fact, because microcomputers are employed in many safety-critical devices, injury or death may result if there are hardware and/or software faults. Consequently, testing must be considered in the original design, during development of intermediate components, and in the final product. The role of simulation is becoming increasingly important in today’s market place as we race to build better and better machines with shorter and shorter design cycles. An effective approach to building embedded systems is to first design the system using a hardware/software simulator, then download and test the system on an actual microcontroller.</p>
					<h4>Introduction to Computers</h4>
                    <p>A computer combines a processor, random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), and input/output (I/O) ports. The common bus in Figure 2.8 defines the von Neumann architecture. Computers are not intelligent. Rather, you are the true genius. Computers are electronic idiots. They can store a lot of data, but they will only do exactly what we tell them to do. Fortunately, however, they can execute our programs quite quickly, and they don’t get bored doing the same tasks over and over again. Software is an ordered sequence of very specific instructions that are stored in memory, defining exactly what and when certain tasks are to be performed. It is a set of instructions, stored in memory, that are executed in a complicated but well-defined manner. The processor executes the software by retrieving and interpreting these instructions one at a time. A microprocessor is a small processor, where small refers to size (i.e., it fits in your hand) and not computational ability. For example, Intel Xeon E7, AMD Fusion, and Sun SPARC are microprocessors. An ARM® Cortex™-M microcontroller includes a processor together with the bus and some peripherals.</p>

                    <p>A microcomputer is a small computer, where again small refers to size (i.e., you can carry it) and not computational ability. For example, a desktop PC is a microcomputer. Small in this context describes its size not its computing power. Consequently, there can be great confusion over the term microcomputer, because it can refer to a very wide range of devices from a PIC12C508, which is an 8-pin chip with 512 words of ROM and 25 bytes RAM, to the most powerful I7-based personal computer. <br>
                        <br>

                        A port is a physical connection between the computer and its outside world. Ports allow information to enter and exit the system. Information enters via the input ports and exits via the output ports. Other names used to describe ports are I/O ports, I/O devices, interfaces, or sometimes just devices. A bus is a collection of wires used to pass information between modules. <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        A very small microcomputer, called a microcontroller, contains all the components of a computer (processor, memory, I/O) on a single chip. As shown in Figure 2.9, the Atmel ATtiny, the Texas Instruments MSP430, and the Texas Instruments TM4C123 are examples of microcontrollers. Because a microcomputer is a small computer, this term can be confusing because it is used to describe a wide range of systems from a 6-pin ATtiny4 running at 1 MHz with 512 bytes of program memory to a personal computer with state-of-the-art 64-bit multi-core processor running at multi-GHz speeds having terabytes of storage. <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        The computer can store information in RAM by writing to it, or it can retrieve previously stored data by reading from it. RAMs are volatile; meaning if power is interrupted and restored the information in the RAM is lost. Most microcontrollers have static RAM (SRAM) using six metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOS or MOSFET) to create each memory bit. Four transistors are used to create two cross-coupled inverters that store the binary information, and the other two are used to read and write the bit.</p>	
                        <div class="featured">
                            <figure>
                                <img src="img/blog-img/embedded4.png" >
                                
                            </figure>
                        </div>
                       
                        <p>Information is programmed into ROM using techniques more complicated than writing to RAM. From a programming viewpoint, retrieving data from a ROM is identical to retrieving data from RAM. ROMs are nonvolatile; meaning if power is interrupted and restored the information in the ROM is retained. Some ROMs are programmed at the factory and can never be changed. A Programmable ROM (PROM) can be erased and reprogrammed by the user, but the erase/program sequence is typically 10000 times slower than the time to write data into a RAM. Some PROMs are erased with ultraviolet light and programmed with voltages, while electrically erasable PROM (EEPROM) are both erased and programmed with voltages. We cannot program ones into the ROM. We first erase the ROM, which puts ones into the entire memory, and then we program the zeros as needed. Flash ROM is a popular type of EEPROM. Each flash bit requires only two MOSFET transistors. The input (gate) of one transistor is electrically isolated, so if we trap charge on this input, it will remain there for years. The other transistor is used to read the bit by sensing whether or not the other transistor has trapped charge. In regular EEPROM, you can erase and program individual bytes. Flash ROM must be erased in large blocks. On many of Stellaris family of microcontrollers, we can erase the entire ROM or just a 1024-byte block. Because flash is smaller than regular EEPROM, most microcontrollers have a large flash into which we store the software. For all the systems in this class, we will store instructions and constants in flash ROM and place variables and temporary data in static RAM.</p>
                        <h4> I/O Ports</h4>
									<p>he external devices attached to the microcontroller provide functionality for the system. An input port is hardware on the microcontroller that allows information about the external world to be entered into the computer. The microcontroller also has hardware called an output port to send information out to the external world. Most of the pins shown in Figure 2.11 are input/output ports. <br>
										<br>

										An interface is defined as the collection of the I/O port, external electronics, physical devices, and the software, which combine to allow the computer to communicate with the external world. An example of an input interface is a switch, where the operator toggles the switch, and the software can recognize the switch position. An example of an output interface is a light-emitting diode (LED), where the software can turn the light on and off, and the operator can see whether or not the light is shining. There is a wide range of possible inputs and outputs, which can exist in either digital or analog form. In general, we can classify I/O interfaces into four categories <br>
										<br>
										
											   Parallel - binary data are available simultaneously on a group of lines <br>
											   <br>
										
											   Serial - binary data are available one bit at a time on a single line <br>
											   <br>
										
											   Analog - data are encoded as an electrical voltage, current, or power <br>
											   <br>
										
                                               Time - data are encoded as a period, frequency, pulse width, or phase shift</p>
                                               <h4>CPU Registers</h4>
                                    <p>Registers are high-speed storage inside the processor. The registers are depicted in Figure. R0 to R12 are general purpose registers and contain either data or addresses. Register R13 (also called the stack pointer, SP) points to the top element of the stack. Register R14 (also called the link register, LR) is used to store the return location for functions. The LR is also used in a special way during exceptions, such as interrupts. Interrupts are covered in Chapter 12. Register R15 (also called the program counter, PC) points to the next instruction to be fetched from memory. The processor fetches an instruction using the PC and then increments the PC.</p>

                                    <p>The ARM Architecture Procedure Call Standard, AAPCS, part of the ARM Application Binary Interface (ABI), uses registers R0, R1, R2, and R3 to pass input parameters into a C function. Also according to AAPCS we place the return parameter in Register R0. In this class, the SP will always be the main stack pointer (MSP), not the Process Stack Pointer (PSP).

                                        There are three status registers named Application Program Status Register (APSR), the Interrupt Program Status Register (IPSR), and the Execution Program Status Register (EPSR) as shown in Figure 2.13. These registers can be accessed individually or in combination as the Program Status Register (PSR). The N, Z, V, C, and Q bits give information about the result of a previous ALU operation. In general, the N bit is set after an arithmetical or logical operation signifying whether or not the result is negative. Similarly, the Z bit is set if the result is zero. The C bit means carry and is set on an unsigned overflow, and the V bit signifies signed overflow.  The Q bit indicates that “saturation” has occurred – while you might want to look it up, saturated arithmetic is beyond the scope of this class.</p>
