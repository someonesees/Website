                            <h6>“The purpose of quantum computing based compassionate artificial intelligence is to develop integrated systems that can preserve and enhance human values of peace, love, happiness and freedom.”</h6>
                            <p>Quantum computing is the use of quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform computation. Computers that perform quantum computations are known as quantum computers.[1]:I-5 Quantum computers are believed to be able to solve certain computational problems, such as integer factorization (which underlies RSA encryption), substantially faster than classical computers. The study of quantum computing is a subfield of quantum information science.</p>
                            <p>There are several models of quantum computing, including the quantum circuit model, quantum Turing machine, adiabatic quantum computer, one-way quantum computer, and various quantum cellular automata. The most widely used model is the quantum circuit. Quantum circuits are based on the quantum bit, or "qubit", which is somewhat analogous to the bit in classical computation. Qubits can be in a 1 or 0 quantum state, or they can be in a superposition of the 1 and 0 states. However, when qubits are measured the result of the measurement is always either a 0 or a 1; the probabilities of these two outcomes depend on the quantum state that the qubits were in immediately prior to the measurement. Computation is performed by manipulating qubits with quantum logic gates, which are somewhat analogous to classical logic gates.</p>
                            <p>Any computational problem that can be solved by a classical computer can also, in principle, be solved by a quantum computer. Conversely, quantum computers obey the Church–Turing thesis; that is, any computational problem that can be solved by a quantum computer can also be solved by a classical computer. While this means that quantum computers provide no additional advantages over classical computers in terms of computability, they do in theory enable the design of algorithms for certain problems that have significantly lower time complexities than known classical algorithms. Notably, quantum computers are believed to be able to quickly solve certain problems that no classical computer could solve in any feasible amount of time—a feat known as "quantum supremacy." The study of the computational complexity of problems with respect to quantum computers is known as quantum complexity theory.</p>
                            <h4>Quantum operations</h4>
                            <p>The prevailing model of quantum computation describes the computation in terms of a network of quantum logic gates. <br>
                                <br>

                                A memory consisting of bits of information has {\textstyle 2^{n}}{\textstyle 2^{n}} possible states. A vector representing all memory states thus has {entries (one for each state). This vector is viewed as a probability vector and represents the fact that the memory is to be found in a particular state. <br>
                                    <br>
                                
                                In the classical view, one entry would have a value of 1 (i.e. a 100% probability of being in this state) and all other entries would be zero. In quantum mechanics, probability vectors are generalized to density operators. This is the technically rigorous mathematical foundation for quantum logic gates, but the intermediate quantum state vector formalism is usually introduced first because it is conceptually simpler. This article focuses on the quantum state vector formalism for simplicity. <br>
                                <br>
                                
                                We begin by considering a simple memory consisting of only one bit. This memory may be found in one of two states: the zero state or the one state. We may represent the state of this memory using Dirac notation so that</p>
                            
                                    
                            <div class="featured">
                                <figure>
                                    <img src="img/blog-img/quant1.png" style="height: 50%; width: 40%;">
                                    
                                </figure>
                            </div>

                            <p>A quantum memory may then be found in any quantum superposition of the two classical states 0 and 1 :</p>
                            <div class="featured">
                                <figure>
                                    <img src="img/blog-img/quant2.png" style="height: 50%; width: 40%;">
                                    
                                </figure>
                            </div>
                            <p>In general, the coefficients  and  are complex numbers. In this scenario, one qubit of information is said to be encoded into the quantum memory. The state  is not itself a probability vector but can be connected with a probability vector via a measurement operation. If the quantum memory is measured to determine if the state is  or  (this is known as a computational basis measurement), the zero state would be observed with probability and the one state with probability. The numbers and  are called quantum amplitudes.</p>
                            <p>The state of this one-qubit quantum memory can be manipulated by applying quantum logic gates, analogous to how classical memory can be manipulated with classical logic gates. One important gate for both classical and quantum computation is the NOT gate, which can be represented by a matrix</p>
                            <div class="featured">
                                <figure>

                            <p>Mathematically, the application of such a logic gate to a quantum state vector is modelled with matrix multiplication. Thus X|0> = 1> and X>1 = |0>.</p>
                            <p>The mathematics of single qubit gates can be extended to operate on multiqubit quantum memories in two important ways. One way is simply to select a qubit and apply that gate to the target qubit whilst leaving the remainder of the memory unaffected. Another way is to apply the gate to its target only if another part of the memory is in a desired state. These two choices can be illustrated using another example. The possible states of a two-qubit quantum memory are</p>
                            <div class="featured">
                                <figure>
                                    <img src="img/blog-img/quant4.png" style="height: 50%; width: 50%;">
                                    
                                </figure>
                            </div>
                            <p>The CNOT gate can then be represented using the following matrix:</p>
                            <div class="featured">
                                <figure>
                                    <img src="img/blog-img/quant6.png" style="height: 40%; width: 40%;">
                                    
                                </figure>
                            </div>
                        
                        <p>As a mathematical consequence of this definition CNOT|00> = |00>, CNOT|01> = |01> , CNOT|10> = |11> and CNOT|11> = |10> . In other words, the CNOT applies a NOT gate X to the second qubit if and only if the first qubit is in the state |1> . If the first qubit is |0>, nothing is done to either qubit.</p>	
                        <p> A quantum computation can be described as a network of quantum logic gates and measurements. Any measurement can be deferred to the end of a quantum computation, though this deferment may come at a computational cost. Because of this possibility of deferring a measurement, most quantum circuits depict a network consisting only of quantum logic gates and no measurements. More information can be found in the following articles: universal quantum computer, Shor's algorithm, Grover's algorithm, Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm, amplitude amplification, quantum Fourier transform, quantum gate, quantum adiabatic algorithm and quantum error correction.</p>
                        <h4>How Do Quantum Computers Work?</h4>
                        <p>Quantum computers perform calculations based on the probability of an object's state before it is measured - instead of just 1s or 0s - which means they have the potential to process exponentially more data compared to classical computers. <br>
                            <br>

                            Classical computers carry out logical operations using the definite position of a physical state. These are usually binary, meaning its operations are based on one of two positions. A single state - such as on or off, up or down, 1 or 0 - is called a bit. <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            In quantum computing, operations instead use the quantum state of an object to produce what's known as a qubit. These states are the undefined properties of an object before they've been detected, such as the spin of an electron or the polarisation of a photon. <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            Rather than having a clear position, unmeasured quantum states occur in a mixed 'superposition', not unlike a coin spinning through the air before it lands in your hand. <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            These superpositions can be entangled with those of other objects, meaning their final outcomes will be mathematically related even if we don't know yet what they are.</p>
                        
                        <p>The complex mathematics behind these unsettled states of entangled 'spinning coins' can be plugged into special algorithms to make short work of problems that would take a classical computer a long time to work out... if they could ever calculate them at all. <br>
                            <br>

                            Such algorithms would be useful in solving complex mathematical problems, producing hard-to-break security codes, or predicting multiple particle interactions in chemical reactions.</p>	
                        <h5>Types of quantum computers</h5>
                        <p>Building a functional quantum computer requires holding an object in a superposition state long enough to carry out various processes on them. <br>
                            <br>

                            Unfortunately, once a superposition meets with materials that are part of a measured system, it loses its in-between state in what's known as decoherence and becomes a boring old classical bit. <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            Devices need to be able to shield quantum states from decoherence, while still making them easy to read. <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            Different processes are tackling this challenge from different angles, whether it's to use more robust quantum processes or to find better ways to check for errors.</p>	

                            
                        <h5>Quantum computing supremacy</h5>
                        <p>For the time being, classical technology can manage any task thrown at a quantum computer. Quantum supremacy describes the ability of a quantum computer to outperform their classical counterparts.

                            Some companies, such as IBM and Google, claim we might be close, as they continue to cram more qubits together and build more accurate devices.
                            
                            Not everybody is convinced that quantum computers are worth the effort. Some mathematicians believe there are obstacles that are practically impossible to overcome, putting quantum computing forever out of reach.
                            
                            Time will tell who is right.</p>
