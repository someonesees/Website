                            <h6>Imagine building materials atom by atom, layer by layer, with desired structure and composition. With nanotechnology and materials science, we are already doing just that.</h6>
								<p>The field of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology as an area within Materials Science spans the discovery, fabrication, characterization, modeling and end-use of nanoscale materials.</p>
                                <p>One of the most interesting things about nanotechnology is that the properties of materials may change when the size scale of their dimensions approaches nanometers. Materials scientists work to understand and control those property changes and find new applications for nanostructures of well-known materials.</p>
                                <h4>What is Nanotechnology?</h4>
                                <p>Nanotechnology is science, engineering, and technology conducted at the nanoscale, which is about 1 to 100 nanometers.</p>
                                <p>Nanoscience and nanotechnology are the study and application of extremely small things and can be used across all the other science fields, such as chemistry, biology, physics, materials science, and engineering.</p>
                                <h4>How it Started</h4>
                                <p>The ideas and concepts behind nanoscience and nanotechnology started with a talk entitled “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom” by physicist Richard Feynman at an American Physical Society meeting at the California Institute of Technology (CalTech) on December 29, 1959, long before the term nanotechnology was used. In his talk, Feynman described a process in which scientists would be able to manipulate and control individual atoms and molecules. Over a decade later, in his explorations of ultraprecision machining, Professor Norio Taniguchi coined the term nanotechnology. It wasn't until 1981, with the development of the scanning tunneling microscope that could "see" individual atoms, that modern nanotechnology began.</p>
                                <h4>Fundamental Concepts in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology</h4>
                                <p>It’s hard to imagine just how small nanotechnology is. One nanometer is a billionth of a meter, or 10-9 of a meter. Here are a few illustrative examples:</p>
                                <p>There are 25,400,000 nanometers in an inch</p>
                                <p>A sheet of newspaper is about 100,000 nanometers thick</p>
                                <p>On a comparative scale, if a marble were a nanometer, then one meter would be the size of the Earth</p>
                                <p>Nanoscience and nanotechnology involve the ability to see and to control individual atoms and molecules. Everything on Earth is made up of atoms—the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the buildings and houses we live in, and our own bodies. <br>
                                    <br>
    
                                    But something as small as an atom is impossible to see with the naked eye. In fact, it’s impossible to see with the microscopes typically used in a high school science classes. The microscopes needed to see things at the nanoscale were invented relatively recently—about 30 years ago. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    
                                    Once scientists had the right tools, such as the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and the atomic force microscope (AFM), the age of nanotechnology was born. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    
                                    Although modern nanoscience and nanotechnology are quite new, nanoscale materials were used for centuries. Alternate-sized gold and silver particles created colors in the stained glass windows of medieval churches hundreds of years ago. The artists back then just didn’t know that the process they used to create these beautiful works of art actually led to changes in the composition of the materials they were working with. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    
                                    Today's scientists and engineers are finding a wide variety of ways to deliberately make materials at the nanoscale to take advantage of their enhanced properties such as higher strength, lighter weight, increased control of light spectrum, and greater chemical reactivity than their larger-scale counterparts.</p>	
                                
                                <p>Nanomaterials will lead to a radically new approach to manufacturing materials and devices. Faster computers, advanced pharmaceuticals, controlled drug delivery, biocompatible materials, nerve and tissue repair, crackproof surface coatings, better skin care and protection, more efficient catalysts, better and smaller sensors, even more efficient telecommunications, these are just some areas where nanomaterials will have a major impact. <br>
                                    In order to structure the large field of nanomaterials and nanotechnologies, the GENNESYS project (Grand European Initiative on Nanoscience and Nanotechnology using Neutron- and Synchrotron Radiation Sources) has subdivided the different areas of application of nanomaterials into research and technology fields.</p>
                                
                                <h4>Nanomaterials design</h4>
                                <p>In nanomaterials science, the development of new materials drives many fields of engineering; i.e. alloys with improved mechanical properties and reduced weight, e.g. to increase stiffness and at the same time save weight in aerospace or automotive industries. Composite materials follow the same trend, many of them mimicking the structure of biological tissues like wood, bone, shell, spider silk and many more examples. The use of such new nanomaterials will be essential to address major future global demands such as reducing energy consumption or the ecological impact of almost any product we use.</p>
                                <h6>Structural nanomaterials</h6>
                                <p>These materials based on metallic, ceramic and polymer systems will provide a step change in mechanical and thermal properties. They will be the basis for a wide range of innovations and new applications exploiting nanoscale effects. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Functional or 'smart' materials <br>
                                    <br>
                                    They will drive forward developments in electronic, photonic, structural and magnetic devices. Nanomaterials will raise the development to a new level, employing novel physical, electrical and mechanical effects to make electronics which will be faster, lighter, cheaper, and easier to manufacture, and which will have low power consumption. Simple devices based on nanomaterials will deliver functions which would ordinarily require a more complex mechanism or component, such as the replacement of electrical connections by optical links and improved non-volatile computer memory. Designing materials operation in stringent environments (temperature, pressure, radiation etc.) is also needed.</p>
                                
                                <h6>Polymer nanomaterials</h6>
                                <p>They will advance dramatically as the chemical and nanoscale structures of polymers are engineered to create new polymers with a multitude of structural and functional applications, ranging from polymers with improved biodegradability to new adhesives and novel electrical conductors. Biopolymers for the life sciences will use the principles of hierarchical assembly in living organisms and apply them to engineered materials and structures. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Nanostructured coatings, composites and hybrids <br>
                                    <br>
                                    These can be engineered to exploit a revolutionary combination of tailored properties, between coating and substrate, between composite matrix and reinforcement, and between the different components of a hybrid.</p>	
                                
                                <h5>Engineering properties of nanomaterials</h5>
                                <p>There will be significant challenges in transferring the knowledge of new nanomaterials properties and mechanisms into the engineering design process, as we are not yet at the stage where nanomaterials can be designed and produced with known properties.
                                    Understanding is required of how nanomaterials can be joined without destroying their nanostructure and their function, how nanomaterials fail through corrosion, creep and fatigue, and how nanotribological mechanisms affect friction, adhesion, wear and lubrication.
                                    The overall lifecycle of the component must be assessed and understood, if accurate predictions are to be made. This could be demonstrated by monitoring in-situ the crack propagation along grain boundaries in steel alloys during corrosion using synchrotron radiation. This is extremely relevant to understand the mechanisms of material failure due to cracking of stainless steel under mechanical stress.</p>
                                
                                <h6>Nanojoining</h6>
                                <p>The study has highlighted potential techniques for nanojoining methodologies and technologies, and pinpointed research paths for successful development. Understanding the reliability and strength of nanoscale and nanostructured joints in-service is a great challenge. Existing knowledge and methods for large-scale welding and joining cannot be extrapolated to new methods and nanoscale effects.</p>
                                <h6>Nanotribology</h6>
                                <p>The study of friction, wear and adhesion at the nanometer scale requires knowledge of surface interactions, chemical environment effects, lubrication, mechanical stresses, as well as biochemical concepts. This field is rapidly developing, but most of the applications that can be realized exploiting nanotribological ideas are still in an embryonic stage.</p>
                                <h6>Life cycle of nanomaterials</h6>
                                <p>The lifetime of an operating nano-architecture is limited by fracture, fatigue, creep, corrosion that will differ significantly from those that operate in ?conventional? structural materials. A mechanistic understanding of the damage mechanisms operating at the nanoscale, obtained using in situ synchrotron radiation and neutron experimentation, will be critical to generate the knowledge base needed for the reliable application of nanomaterials in engineering applications. The understanding of nano damage mechanisms is needed as input in simulation models.</p>	
                                <h5>Challenges in nanomaterials technologies</h5>
                                <p>The GENNESYS study highlights the enormous potential impact of nanomaterials for new technologies. The opportunities for nanomaterials research and development have been defined for a broad spectrum of technological application areas to deliver unprecedented impact in fields encompassing faster information exchange and new multi-functional computer systems enhanced healthcare, with new drugs through bio-nanotechnologies and nanotherapies in medicine; more energy-efficient transport encompassing light-weight structural materials; reduced pollution and carbon emissions; and technologies for safety and risk reduction. The goal is the enhancement of these technologies for improved quality of life, through the development and production of new materials with novel properties. These breakthroughs critically rely upon advancing our fundamental knowledge of nanomaterials.</p>
                                <h6>Information Technology</h6>
                                <p>The future prosperity of the information technology industry strongly depends on further successful down-scaling processes, creating new devices with higher functionalities, greater flexibility and reliability, and improved performance. Nanoscience and -technology will provide important basic approaches for improved functionalities and new device concepts. The new nanoelectronics will give a step change in functionality ? higher speeds, reduced power consumption, reduced complexity ? that will provide novel computer, photonics and informatics applications over the next 20 years. <br>
                                    In microelectronics and photonics, new developments such as quantum communication and computing, data storage using new materials, and concepts such as magnetic semiconductors and spintronics, will revolutionize capabilities. Most of these concepts are based on nanostructures, and in most of these cases structural studies using synchrotron and neutron sources are essential.</p>
                                
                                <h6>Health: biological and medical applications</h6>	
                                <p>The entire scope where nanomaterials impact human health, through medicine, dentistry, cosmetics, food and agriculture, has been evaluated. The healthcare industry is dependent on drugs and drug delivery systems for disease control and improving the quality of life. New drug systems with controlled release can be developed using nanoengineering, and the delivery of drugs into the human body is much simplified by exploiting nanoscale effects i.e. delivering just the amount of drugs necessary to patients allows decreasing the amount of drugs and the impact of pollution since the excess is often released in the environment.New ointments which exploit nanoscale binders will have offshoots into the cosmetics industry, which will be able to exploit the research and development needed for the full exploitation of nanomaterials in healthcare. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Nutrition is critically important for health and the quality of life. Increasing demands for more efficient food production and processing, the possibility of engineering foodstuffs for improved nutrition, and the development of foodstuffs designed to be suitable for people with allergies or nutritional disorders will all require a step change in our ability to manipulate the structure of materials at the nanoscale. In particular, being able to formulate foods which can be successfully processed is of fundamental importance.</p>
                                <h6>Manufacturing engineering</h6>
                                <p>Nanomaterials have to meet the demands facing new structural materials, reduced energy consumption, and reduced life-cycle costs. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Advances include reduced fuel consumption and operating costs, reduced or zero emissions, improved capacity and comfort and reduced noise. Breakthroughs in nanomaterials engineering depend on how precise we can ?see? the relevant structures and how they change during a process. This puts serious demands on tailored analytical tools ranging from diffraction, imaging, microscopy, tomography and spectroscopy with highest spatial resolution (<50 nm). </p>	
                                    
                                <h5>Nanomaterials in energy technologies</h5>
                                <p>Climate change and the security of energy supply are two of the most pressing concerns facing both developed and developing countries alike. To tackle energy consumption and associated problems, no other way than using renewable sources and developing nuclear energy will be possible in the medium to long term. Saving energy and an efficient use of it are the basic requirements in this evolution.</p>

                                <p>The potential impact that nanomaterials can make in this area is truly enormous. If current projections are correct, they could achieve transformational changes in the way we convert and use energy, providing a sustainable, clean, efficient and above all decarbonized energy system. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The study of materials for energy is extremely broad and covers a very diverse set of materials embracing functional, chemical and electronic energy materials. Development of nanomaterials for these applications will require, for all the different materials types, the probing of structure at all length and time scales.</p>
                                
                                <h6>Environment</h6>	
                                <p>n natural and man-made environment, nanotechnology will help to solve problems like soil and groundwater remediation, air purification, pollution detection and sensing. The same is true for man-made waste reduction including nuclear waste which also requires developing safe geological disposal with methods acceptable for society. A better prediction of climate change is directly linked to the understanding of the role of aerosols (nanoparticles) in the atmosphere.</p>
                                <h6>Security and safety</h6>
                                <p>Nanotechnology will bring new answers to the prevention and protection against terrorism threats, or against natural and industrial accidental risks. Nanotechnology will also provide efficient response to the security and safety of critical installations and the environment.</p>
                                <h6>Nanometrology research and standardization</h6>
                                <p>A new generation of nanomaterials will require a new concept of measurement techniques for the characterization and the determination of their physical properties. These nanostandardization methods will also become increasingly important in proving validation of novel measurement techniques in order to assure their reproducibility, quality, robustness and accuracy. Alongside the development of any new measurement technique, it is vital that it is applied in a standard, reproducible way. Modern industry relies heavily on standardization of measurement, processes, methods and products, and on the use of Standard Reference Materials. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Good practice in metrology requires standardization of any new or improved measurement techniques, standardization in information and data reporting and interpretation, and globally-accepted standards for measurement. All of these are critically important for the study of properties and structures at the nanoscale.</p>
